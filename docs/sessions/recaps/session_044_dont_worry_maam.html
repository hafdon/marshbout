Flick was alerted with her morning coffee; once she'd laid a few coppers on the table the innkeeper &quot;remembered&quot; receiving a message from a messenger owl.</p> <blockquote><p>Ian and DK roll for gems in the satchels they got from the burrowlings.</p></blockquote> <p>Drav is always looking to improve her general wizardry and also dwarven history.</p> <p>The library is related to the [Bloodsledge Clan]; the [Archives of Ten-Axe of Bloodsledge].</p> <p>Dwarves love latinate puns.</p> <p>Most of the population of [Meliansein] is [Bloodsledge dwarves]; the archives there are carved into the sandstone hills.</p> <p>Flick pulls the letter from Drav out of her pocket and reminds the team that they have to meet up with Drav at the Archives. It's still early afternoon.</p> <p>Vengeance has been tossing his hawkhatchet up in the air and catching it as he's been walking, an action which has improved his Dexterity. Vengeance only failed to catch it once, taking <code>[1]</code> point of slicing damage in one of his toes, which is what's leaving the trail of bloody footprints. This cut off a toe, which evened out his feet (the other foot was already missing a toe) is what improved his Dexterity.</p> <p>Flick is eager to see Drav, feeling like she's been gone for a month.</p> <p>Drav had left early in the morning after sending the message and luckily made it without molestation. She made it to town mid-morning. She came in on the southern roads, passing by some spooky woods to her left. They were darker and gloomier than to be expected of woods on the outskirts of a town. <code>[Arcana 12]</code> She feels a slight tingly in the wood, maybe some arcane flickerings, a little different from the mundane, but doesn't make the hair stand up on her neck. It's still morning, the bay to her brights is clear blue water; there's a lot fo ship activity on the ports. She heads north past the market square and sees what's his face selling fish and shrimp who gives her ooglie eyes; she casts her gaze ahead towards Meliansein.</p> <p>Historically, the community here was chosen because the dwarves hewed close to the sandstone hills forming the banks of the river. The hills prevent floodplains from forming when the mountain thaw causes the river to swell. However, there are wild and tangled coves carved into the sandstone under the level of the ground near the river delta.</p> <blockquote><p>It is established that the culture of the littoral is Amish on the top, Gangster on the bottom.</p></blockquote> <p>This town, Sandford, may have the problem of wild Rumspringas too.</p> <p>There are other dwarves throughout the town, but they are concentrated here.</p> <h2 id="archives-of-ten-axe-bloodsledge"><a href="#archives-of-ten-axe-bloodsledge" class="header-anchor">#</a> Archives of Ten-Axe Bloodsledge</h2> <p>Drav arrives at the Archives. The space resembles one of the great halls when there were huge dwarven empires that spanned entire mountain ranges. There are delicately thin pillars which appear to hold up the cave ceiling, which allow her to pass into a completely silent space into an almost boxy reception room. There is a servitor at the entrance, introducing themselves as one of the heirs of the Bloodsledge family, taking Drav's dwarven credentials as a matter of fact. They show Drav to the stacks, and let her know of the museum component with used objects, some of which are paeans to Ten-Axe, and some which represent life in those days.</p> <ul><li><p>&quot;Other dwarven clans may have led you to expect something more bureaucratic, but here we believe in the innate equality of individuals without requiring them to prove themselves before a faceless maze of paperwork and credentialism. Are you interested in the library or the museum?&quot; and they wait expectantly.</p></li> <li><p>Drav: I think the museum side.</p></li> <li><p>The servitor looks around. &quot;It seems we're in for a noontime rush&quot; (even the sound of the dripping water has completely ceased) &quot;but perhaps for some consideration I could offer you a tour&quot; He leans over at the hip obsequiously.</p></li> <li><p>Drav: Very generous of you.</p></li> <li><p>Servitor: &quot;Very generous of you too!&quot; he waits expectantly.</p></li> <li><p>Drav offers a coin.</p></li> <li><p>&quot;Yes there are tours to accommodate this degree of magnanimity.&quot;</p></li></ul> <p>He walks Drav into a large hemicylindrical cave, on the sides are engraved gigantic statues. Ten-Axe is depicted in various heroic positions: slaying a dragon?, saving children? baking pig? only Ten-Axe is depicted, so Drav is left to imagine the other figures. The ancient ruler's strength, wisdom, and charisma is intended to be conveyed through these images.</p> <p>Meanwhile the servitor has retreated from the space and disappeared. A lot of the artefacts bear placards, so his presence isn't entirely necessary. <code>[Investigation 25]</code></p> <p>Growing up with elven parents, Drav didn't get much exposure to Dwarven history or masonry (for which she feels a definite desidiria).</p> <p>Under a sculpture of Ten-Axe carving his way deep under the heart of a mountain (wielding a sledgehammer in one hand and a pick in the other), Drav detects examples carved into the nearby sandstone illustrating some of the old styles of masonry: some for reinforcing caves, on one is an incantation which would allow her to strengthen an area of rock. And some more artistic designs throughout the periods of history Ten-Axe flourished. There's some history provided as well. (DM describes the original Moraddin's Crown, with a desert to the west.)</p> <blockquote><p>Thousands of years ago, when the [Strictland] was ruled by [a single Dwarven empire] and the peoples thereof. His familiarity and expertise with stone, and his ability to merge with it, allowed him to fend off the Desert.</p></blockquote> <p>Vengeance sent a message to Drav in return for her message, &quot;If you happen to go to any museums, please see if there are any spellbooks which allow you to open portals to the dwarven astral plane.&quot;</p> <blockquote><p>Had Drav received the message before she departed, she likely would have had no idea what a dwarven astral plane was -- although on deeper consideration may have taken Venny to be referring to the prismatic powers of Eldar.</p></blockquote> <p>The hieroglyphics also depict how the Bloodforge clan used to be one with the Bloodsledge clan, but the Forge was awarded [Moraddin]'s favor, and split off, which is why today they crowd around the &quot;new&quot; Moraddin's crown at the north of the Nephil Mountains.</p> <p>Drav grabs a couple pamphlets</p> <p>!-- clearly has to be from the [Sextet of Sextants] isn't even introduced until the fifth quadrology</p> <ul><li><p>by historical quirk, every shitty series has to be a tetrology in the marshbout world. so there are plenty of franchises where you don't need that fourth book, -- half the time it's a prequel. how many times do i really have to hear about how [Devodee'anar ran afoul of the ash maidens]. stop rewriting it!</p></li> <li><p>we get it, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, give us a new rhyme.</p></li> <li><p>&quot;although i heard the new tetrology is about [Delphine], who has a lot of public support behind her. -- it really depends on who they get to write her. -- they don't credit any of their ghost writers. they're all credited to an [A. B. McSchwartzman], and the ghost writers are all literal ghosts.</p></li></ul> <p>all the printing presses are literally possessed, and do it all themselves -- they are awakened printing presses. that's how they pump the stories out so fast.</p> <p>in fact, one of the machines the gnomes came to melford to improve was one of their ghost-run printing presses. --;</p> <p>flick et al approach the desk , the sound of water trickling.</p> <p>flick: is there something wrong with the plumbing?</p> <p>servitor: no, this is an archives, which can have whichever plumbing they wish</p> <p>flick: did a dwarf named drav come by?</p> <p>servitor: i wouldn't presume to a level of familiarity which would allow me to speculate on the identify of an acquaintance of yours.</p> <p>flick: oh one of these guys. she looks for a posted policy.</p> <p>servitor: you know my doctor told me recently that palpating fine metals can act as an aide memoir in recollecting names and faces</p> <p>Venny attempts to sneak past the servitor by dropping to his knees and adorning himself with a &quot;hat basket&quot; which he'd fashioned out of some reeds growing alongside the Strigge River. So enamored with Flick's jewelry is the servitor that he completely misses an utterly conspicuous Venny staking past him holding one or two branches. it is actuallly possible, if the servitor were not eyeing the jewelry, that he is blind.</p> <p>flick: good sir archivist, i'm actually looiking or something</p> <p>servitor: well believe it or not i'm also the head librarian</p> <p>flick: i'm actually looking for something written by a dr. sanctfeld imst and his <em>mental perturbations</em>. i've heard that he distilled that work out of some fieldwork he did in the south and tropical regions.</p> <p>of course the infamous psycholologist and herbabologist. these materials here are restricted to those pertaining to Ten-Axe of the bloodsledge clan, and his heirs and etc. and any historical events which may or may not have causative influence to those peoples</p> <p>flick: surely you must know that Ten-Axe contributed materially to the Imst expedition of 1685, and surely you have some kind of miscellany pertaining to that.</p> <p>Drav can barely hear anything because of the amazing study acoustics, except for the persistent dripping sound. Meanwhile, Flick's efforts are rebuffed. &quot;Don't try to put one past me, Elf, I know that Ten-Axe never headed south of the Aldran region, and in fact would have experienced great difficulty living there giving his mountainous constituion.&quot;</p> <p>Flick: Ok, well -- I'm here to meet my friend, and I will wait here. By all maeans, our benches are very comfortable by all accounts. Flick doesn't sit on the benches that aren't there.</p> <p>Drav returns to a cart her copy of [Inveterate Worm Rocks and the History of Insecure Foundations in the Blood Mountains]and heads out to the foyer. She immediately notices the air of churlishness and petulance radiating from Flick just as the figure of Vengeance, crawling on knees and draped with vinery, pushes past her. The handsome, golden image of Jean-Luc, backlit by the very incredibly tiny distant square provided by the long long corridor. His flowing locks glow ever so slightly. Frosted tips, just like the Frosted Orcs in the north are known to wear.</p> <p>Vengeance: Hey Drav. Fancy meeting you here. Psst, it's me, Vengeauns, im in disguise. Don't worry, i'm also going to disguise my voice just to be safe.</p> <p>Drav: Uh oh, hey guys, what's going on.</p> <p>Flick: Drav! It's been too long. She pops up and gives her a hug. I think we should be on our way.</p> <p>Did you find the facilities satisfactory? the servitor asks Drav.</p> <p>Drav: very much so, although I sense a little tension between . we'll be on our way now.</p> <p>the servitor gives her <span style="text-decoration:underline;">[a beard comb carved out of rockbone]</span>,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> a hard white rock, wrapped in a little velvet comb case. and some beard oil contained within a slim glass vial sealed with red wax stamped with the full name of the archives.</span></p> <p>Drav: Uhhhh, thank you, and she stowes them in her satchel.</p> <h2 id="the-secret-thieves-meeting-scavenger-hunt"><a href="#the-secret-thieves-meeting-scavenger-hunt" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Secret Thieves Meeting Scavenger Hunt</h2> <p>Twilight approaches.</p> <p>JL: i think it's safe to assume this is not an ambush, i think we should go in and &quot;you should behave yourselves&quot; (staring at Vengeance). i'll be honest, I have no idea what they want with me other than our mutual enemy.</p> <p>Vengeance: yes, i agree with JL, could you all for once try to keep a low profile.</p> <p>JL: We'll try to avoid fighting our way out of hear.</p> <p>JL goes up to the house and quietly knocks on the door. Flick is 10 feet behind. A few moments go by and an old woman answers the door. She's waring a lace bonnet and muslin pyjamas. &quot;Yes&quot;</p> <p>JL shows her the dagger.</p> <p>Oh take anything you want! Mervin, don't resist! There's burglars here!</p> <p>JL: i think you might have misread my intentions.</p> <p>Flick: Are we at the right house?</p> <p>JL: I'm not sure -- double-checks the map.</p> <p>Vengeance pushes his head in, a basket women on his head. &quot;I think you know what we're here for.&quot;</p> <p>Im' sorry I don't know what this is? You wish to see the basement and you won't hurt us? Go take a look.</p> <p>JL has had weirded starts to a meeting than this. He walks to the basement, and Vengeance subly tips over knick-knacks.</p> <p>Please my baskethead be careful! those are precious heirlooms!</p> <p>Vengeance: They look like chochkeys to me</p> <p>There's no need to be insulting as well as criminal.</p> <p>Flick: We're not here to take anything, mam. we were told to be at this address at this time.</p> <p>I don't know who could ahve told you that.</p> <p>The basement looks like a root cellar, there are dried goods, pickled goods, root vegetables, wine, bread</p> <p>JL, coming back up the stairs, and above the door frame he notices something etched above the door. Looking closer, he sees in a thieves' cant longhand it says &quot;have you tried reflecting on the address again?&quot;</p> <p>Flick: fuck me, and pulls out a hand mirror that's part of her cosmetics kit.</p> <p>JL: bullshit cryptography. JL, reading teh map, looks at it in a reflection. Flick is so used to honing the points of her arrow heads, she thinks --- it's weird that the market square in the middle is outlined in a darker color, esp with the sharp corners, she remembers that the corners of the square were softer. they try folding the map along one axis, which creates another blue dot in a different location</p> <p>JL: our apologies, mam</p> <p>oh, thank you, would you mind picking up the items</p> <p>flick: for your troubles mam (and holds out a gemstone)</p> <p>are you trying to get me murdered, i haven't held that much money in my entire life</p> <p>flick holds out two silver jots</p> <p>oh so generous! no, jk,</p> <p>vengeanec knocks over a callico critter.</p> <p>that was the last one in the collection! maybe I will take the gemstone.</p> <p>vengeance: i've collected from people like this before, I know how this works.</p> <p>They make their way over to the other dot, which is in an area that's more spacious houses, but off the beaten path of the estates that oversee the market road into town. some have garden plots. because of the reflection, it could be one of two houses. JL gets into the area, and looks at Vengeance, he's' a weird dude, but sometimes he's more intuitive than you might give him credit for. he's not feeling particular antagonism towards either one; you think because of that, neither one of tehse is it, and maybe you've taken the wrong tack</p> <p>JL keeps looking for some theives' cant. there's something he acn't parse, maybe it's Sandford specific, but if he could get someone who knows languages. He gives Flick a quick lesson on structure of thieve's cant. Nouns and verbs are vertical placement of symbols (higher is more active than lower)</p> <p>Flick knows that abyssal is spatially pictographic in a similar way. She asks Drav if she knows &quot;Comprehend Languages&quot;. Because I don't know what the fuck these hobo scribblings mean at all.</p> <p>So Drav reaches out an touches thieves' cant written on a refuse bin that was clearly put out the night before, part of some endurance test you're being put through. &quot;Sharp metal also reflects&quot;</p> <p>Vengeane takes out his bagpipes. &quot;I think I know what to do here, everybody&quot; He plays heavy metal, but slightly sharp. (the song) . (about when you have too much armor on) . Vengeance learned the song from reading -- and then imagining an interpretation.</p> <p>Flick asks for a Dagger from JL. She holds it up to the thieves' cant so it's reflected along the horizontal axis, and asks Drav what that means. Drav touches the bin and the dagger.</p> <p>Flick: we're supposed to deduce a new point on the map.</p> <p>JL notices that the point of the dagger was at the strong point of the market square. They line the dagger point to point with the market square corner. It's fashioned such that the point is reflected back to the north, and if you look closely they see that the map has very faint circular markings around the spot.</p> <p>JL: seems a little showboaty of them</p> <p>Flick: when you're the hat baskets, you have to prove you're hard in some other way.</p> <p>They head over to that new point. The streets seem quiet. teh group is headed there just walking like normal, a bit hurried, at a brisk pace.</p> <p>Vengeance is playing bagpipes. An arrow thunks into the wood inches from JL's nose, a note wrapped around the arrow.</p> <p>Flick immediately runs to put her back up against a building on the side of the street she's closest to, and nocks an arrow. They are surrounded by three-story buildings, and she can't detect anyting. JL motions for Flick to put her bow down. JL looks at the note and sees a picture of a wanted poster. The issuer -- it looks like an underground source. signed by Yolindar, 10,000 gp. JL: it's rather flattering, and I didn't think I caused so much trouble.</p> <p>flick: what did you do, sleep with their spouse?</p> <p>Yolindar: lady</p> <p>JL: bisexual</p> <p>JL and Yolindar were never involved, canon.</p> <p>JL, on my last job I may or may not have foiled a kidnapping plot, although I don't think it was for 10,000 dollars so this may be an overreaction on their part. (he realizes they may have realizes after he absconded how much it would have been possible to get, or it led to other operations of theirs being compromised. )</p> <p>JL: they already told me that Yolindar put a bounty on me. He turns it over, and there are stick figures of you, one of Vengeance playing bagpipes with large musical notes, noise lines from their steps, people in windows looking at them, to convey conspicuity.</p> <p>JL: this may be a friendly warning to step quietly.</p> <p>Flick: can we have vengeance stop playing Heavy Metal.</p> <p>JL: it's fair, I get it. we may want to retire for the night and have them contact us.</p> <p>Flick: we don't get to have our secret meeting?</p> <p>JK: I think it's poor ettiquette. there's a lot of ceremony, and it's been a while for me.</p> <p><code>[insight nat 20]</code> something about the letter, it's written in <a href="/marshbout/creatures/rosindra.html">rosindra</a>'s hand, and you think, oh, i might have failed this part, but it's still some kind of test.</p> <p>vengeance: as much as i love this font, JL, i wonder if this is a good idea. what do we have to gain? it seems like these people are giving us the runn around. what are we doing this for?</p> <p>JL: they want tot meet, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p> <p>vengeance: they don't seem like good friends if they're treating us this way</p> <p>jl: they don't want us dead, and they could easily profit from my death</p> <p>Flick goes &quot;stealth mode&quot; , as does Vengeance, whose only change is to play a little quieter. And JL walks less conspicuously?</p> <p>They arrive at the last destination. It abuts another market square which probably greetes people coming in from the north. It's a residence that sits on the edge of the square. There's a building that has rounded edges, and one of the edges is a moat with a fountain, next to which hounses were built at some point. as they approach, there's a town constable or warden arguing with a man with an overturned cart, and someone who looks like as aspiring noble wearing armor, and the constable is trying to mediate between them, and they're incidentally blocking the entrance.</p> <p>The argument is that the wagoneer is saying that the knight ran into him, and the knight is saying the wagoneer got in his way. and the wagoneer wants damages paid, and the knight wants a formal indication of his superiority.</p> <p>Vengeance: OMG, you guys, wouldn't it be cool if these turned out to be the thieves, like Jean-Par Mezhan. This could definitely be the case, thinks the group. Flick attends more to the conversation. It does seem like they just started this argument and might be playing for time. Yet just because it's fake doesn't mean it's not a test.</p> <p>JL tests the sight-lines of the area we are in. Logically, what are the odds that this would have happened? There is a T-intersection, but the ground came up the handle, so they would have had to have seen each other. JL quietly approaches and subtly points this out.</p> <p>Kindof interesting that you managed to crash into each other. Surely a knight should be a better rider than to run into a wagon seen from hundreds of feet away.</p> <p><code>[Persuasion bad]</code> They look at JL like he's crazy . the knight maintains that the wagoneer is so drunk it was impossible to avoid him, and teh wagoneer that he's a teetotaller and that his father died from drinking, and his grandfather, and his great-great-grandmother , but not his great-grandmother.</p> <p>Flick: I know it's none of our business, because i'm not part of the constabulary, but if we all put our hats into this basket we can work it all out.</p> <p>constable turns to flick with a sly wink. Flick had pitched her voice to make it sound like an idiom. It's clear that the constable gets what she's saying.</p> <p>&quot;The one must reflect before sticking one's hand in lest one find a pointy edge.&quot; assays Flick.</p> <p>Constable: You have some dangerous baskets you must deal in. Are you really sure you wnt us ALL to stick our hands in this dangerous basket together?</p> <p>Flick: I have enough basket cases -- I'm travelling with enough.</p> <p>Constable: it looks like some basket cases you didn't intend might have glommed onto your trail.</p> <p>Flick and JL look behind themselves to see Rosindra waving to them from a doorway. She's holding a bow.</p> <p>Flick: We'll leave you to workout this business, good KNIGHT.</p> <p>Constable: Do you intend to make your entrance to this place.</p> <p>JL: Sometimes you have to choose several hats since you don't know which ones you're going to need.</p> <p>Constable: it looks like you'll wear them even if they are soggy an falling apart</p> <p>JL: the best disguises are teh most inconspicuous ones. [and he does a hat-tip gesture to Rosindra]</p> <p>The &quot;noble&quot; canters off and the wagoneer with the constable's help gets the wagon straighteneed out. Vengeance tries to swipe something from the back of the wagon. Flick tries to interpose herself and grab his wrist.</p> <p>Vengeance : Flick , we need to prove that we're thieves so they will accept us.</p> <p>The wagon was carrying low value vegetables in a great deal of bunting. So, vengeance reaches out for a (particularlly succulent) single cabbage in a box of hay.</p> <p>JL and DK try to dissuade vengeance.</p> <p>Vengeance: wouldn't stealing something of such low value show that we're true KLEPTOs.</p> <p>Flick walks over to Rosindra, picking her nails in the doorway.</p> <p>F: SOrry to keep you waiting</p> <p>Rosindra: i'm not sure if this has been two failures or threeโฆ it helps me to understand where you land compared to other guild members.</p> <p>JL: I suppose we earned it</p> <p>F: were we supposed to deduce that we had to hold the dagger up to the map?</p> <p>R: it's โฆ it's a clue that others haven't failed to pick up on sooner. ?</p> <p>JL: it's been a while since i've been put through a cryptogram to find a meeting. forgive my rustiness.</p> <p>R: certainly understandable; this technique may be more common near the sandford area, and where metalworking is a high-status industry.</p> <p>V: he didn't want to steal the cabbage either, so clearly he doesn't get it like we do</p> <p>R: you didn't steal a cabbage? why, they were laid out for you to take! Let's consider that four failures</p> <p>Flick is way out of her depth.</p> <p>JL recognizes this as the sort of friendly hazing</p> <p>R :I'm more concerned that you aren't looking out for yourself enough. if anyone had seen these wanted posters across the city they'd have been able to identify you from across the city. i'm not even a good tracker as far as the hat baskets are concerned. true i did know where you were going. i could see you weren't trying to hide at all.</p> <p>JL: this is my first step in a city. I'm surprised that Yolindar's reach is this far, and that anyone tried to claim it.</p> <p>R: it's typically the cowards that try to claim it at first. you're right, we did shoot this poster before those who may have seen it as a bounty</p> <p>F: JL is thirsty</p> <p>R: did someone mention thirst traps? i hear they are big in the academy</p> <p>V: No</p> <p>F: JL goes after interesting company</p> <p>R: that's all part of the game.</p> <p>JL: you invited me here, so I assume you want to talk about the GM, or let us go on our way</p> <p>R: no, you're right, the meeting isn't set until a few minutes hence, at this location, if you'll all follow me.</p> <p>F: THIVES MEETING!</p> <p>Flick heads to the building and realizes she does'nt really know where to go. she awkwardly pretends that that was the plan the whole time. rosindra beckons flick. by now it's almost entirely dark, the sun is setting. there's a little bit of fountain that still exists attached to the building. she sits on the fountain's edge and goes backwards holding her nose, but Rosindra disappears through the bottom.</p> <p>Flick, no entirely sure what triggers the illusion, tries to go in as she did. she lands in a deep pool of water; above her is a gentle waterfall, and rosindra, a few feet ahead, swimming towards a dry area in an underground cave where others are standing.</p> <p>Flick, using her gloves of climbing and swimming, outpaces her. she checks to see that her poison wasn't diluted or bow warped. she stored them well enough that they aren't. Pulling herself up onto the ledge there is a little stone bench with slots in it. Through the slots she can see a glowing , undulating shape. rosindra sits down on it and allows it to dry her clothes. flick follows suit.</p> <p>rosindra: we've managed to obtain a salamander, &quot;<a href="/marshbout/creatures/nubbs.html">nubbs</a>&quot;, which comes in handy ; here it dries off those who come through [the fountain].</p> <p>flick: there must be easier ways to get into your own guild hall, or wherever this is. i mean, i'm all for a little cloak and dagger, but now you're just being twee.</p> <p>JL pops up out of the water. &quot;this is โฆ unnecessarily arduous&quot;</p> <p>rosindra: we had to take special precautions tonight because many of our members were sure you wouldn't pass any of the tests and indeed i think only around half a test was passed, and the mebers who are the most conservative are confusingly th most twee and this is the only way they would agree to having the meeting with you.</p> <p>flick: that's fair enough.</p> <p>vengeance: i won't be needing your towel-mander. although i'd like one for my personal menagerie</p> <p>rosindra: let me connect you with [Sirzis]</p> <p>V: Sir Zeus?</p> <p>R: s-i-r-z-i-s. he's one of the leaders of a lizardfolk tribe. they breed and sell these salamanders.</p> <p>V: gotta catch'em all. sure, i'll take down his information</p> <p>flick: is that what they say?</p> <p>R: i've only heard: &quot;it's best to have just one&quot;</p> <p>v: i thought that was the point of this whole mission</p> <p>r: what mission?</p> <p>v: life</p> <p>r: so you're a creature hoarder?</p> <p>v: we prefer to be called connoisseurs</p> <p>r: i think you're describing a diletantte</p> <p>v: i like to have a lot of creatures around, and i think that makes a person a connoisseur</p> <p>r: what other creatures do you surround yourself with?</p> <p>v: well, these buffoons for one</p> <p>flick rolls her eyes</p> <p>r: so other โฆ humanoids?</p> <p>v: yeah, they are the most precious of all creatures</p> <p>Rosindra turns to JL, who's dried himself off by this point. &quot;We've completed tha tests. why the meeting? I find that most meetings can usually just โฆ&quot;</p> <p>R: this one is the result of some information we received and having done research into your and your companoins past, we did arrange for the wizard to learn about the archive so that she was in town when we brought you over. if you'd take a seat we can explain everything. a number of possible 'snaps' .</p> <p>flick: i might remind you, JL, that we do have promises to keep in the wider world.</p> <p>JL: my companion makes a good point. how many of these are time-sensitive.</p> <p>R: well, in one case, we suspect that the GMs will kill a number of people within the next day. the others aren't much longer, but fewer deaths, so one is quite dire.</p> <p>JL: any opportunity to stick a fork in the eye of the gaol maidens, and i guess save some lives.</p> <p>there are some applecrate benches.</p> <p>[Malenka] stands up and introduces herself. she's a goblin or half-goblin, rather short, has crusty green skin and beyond her goblin provenance there's something a little mentally unstable about her. she's wearing all black; her hands and any exposed surfaces are covered in a thick white lime paste. she's not making eye contact with anyone in the room as she's talking. she furtively looks around the room</p> <p>Malenka: as you all know, i've been able to see by touching the corpse of Trovar after the Gaol Maidens killed her, it is clear that they took the log book, I can't quite see where it is. for those who don't know, the log book is connected to those of the captains who sail in, and deliver our shipments. once they know their destination port and time it appears in their log book and ours, and now .. now the gaol maidens have it. they can't read it yet, because it's under a secure, cryptographic, and tehy don't have they knowledge, โฆ it's clear they intend to kill as many as they can โฆ and other hints as to poisoning our supply or taking the contraband or more valuable objects.</p> <p>Rosindra steps in. Vengeance, &quot;I think everything is very clear , we know what we need to do!&quot;</p> <p>an eyeless, hairless siamese cat follows her and sits down next to her, as she and the cat are trying to divine from living creature's bones.</p> <p>Rosindra, &quot;yes, what malenka has said is true, but the gaol maidens have acquired teh Log of Pathytus&quot; and they can tell where our shipments are coming in, and they aim to destroy, scupper, or steal as much as they can. we need that tome retrieved . since we don't know if it can be retrieved, we need volunteers to sail to captains and intercept them, and would like interventions at the coves, docks, or moorings, and stop anything at the last moment. as is usual, these operations are volunteered. they are our best ideas for stopping casualties, and if there are other suggestions we welcome them.</p> <p>one other has been to assail the GMs at their point of strength in the hope of providing enough of a distraction and killing or tying up enough of them so they can't carry out any raids.</p> <p>JL: i like that last one. i don't think dancing around with ports, or trying to steal back the log book , will work. they are far from home, they can't be that strong from here.</p> <p>Rosindra: it's tru that they are far from home; the difficulty comes in if they are operating with splinter cells, but if they are autonomously operating cells, destroying the HQ may have no effect.</p> <p>JL:</p> <p>YOH-LAHN-DAR (Dk's pronunciation)</p> <p>[Insight 5] She is preoccupied by her religious meditations; she wouldn't necessarily actively persue a strategy of independent cells. She's fairly impetuous, though, so she may have authorized one and forgotten about it. &quot;she might have done that, but it seems worth taking that risk -- obviously I can't volunteer you all for th is mission, but, if we do we could get some sweet loot.</p> <p>vengeance: i'm kind of in favor of stealing a book. it's clean, it might not involve fighting. couldn't they just have made a copy of the book?</p> <p>malenka: the book is uncopiable. they can't read it, let alone copy it.</p> <p>JL: if they can't read it, how did they crack the code?</p> <p>malenka: originally, they wouldn't have been able to reaed it. (she looks at drav) it's a wonder your friend made it down here safely. they've been kidnapping wizards on the road and trying to force them to crack our codes for quite some time.</p> <p>flick: (having thought: that's what all this was for, to run errands for some randos?) kidnapping? really? so they are taking innocent people off the streets?</p> <p>malenka: they don't quite have the abilities to enslave them, but they do manage to make them work in one way or another. typically they don't have to resort to magic.</p> <p>flick: let's put it right back up their ass.</p> <p>JL: do we steal the book, or punch them in the mouth?</p> <p>vengeance: i vote book.</p> <p>drav: i don't like this kidnapping innocents off the street.</p> <p>flick: this would mean taking out the splinter cell--</p> <p>vengeance: if we get the book, drav can read it and we can intercept incoming cargo.</p> <p>Drav and JL smell fumes of an incendiary device. vengeance can smell smoke coming from underneath his applebox. Flick smells smoke coming from somewhere, faintly. it could be the salamander. JL shouts &quot;bomb!&quot; and jumps into the pool.</p> <p>Flick doesn't know what &quot;grenade&quot; is,</p> <p>Drav can see a rectangular mass that has started to emit light in points.</p> <p>vengeance: drav you should try this, the smoke stings so good when you get your eye right up there.</p> <p>Drav wraps her hands around vengeance, pinning his arms to the side , and drags him into the pool.</p> <p>JL's warning alerts slightly fewer than half, who run and jump into the pool in time. Above them, the room fills with liquid fire . For flick, standing in the EP, the grey haze is gone, and a bright sun is shining on you (can't figure out from where) and Flick feels weak, weaker than she's ever felt, and she can still smell the smoke -- and she can't tell where it's coming from. within seconds, the roiling fire burns itself out. clouds of ash billow in the space.</p> <p>JL: clearly they planted the bombs before we were involved, so this isn't our fault.</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/hafdon/obsidian-general/edit/main/sessions/recaps/session_044_dont_worry_maam.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help improve the page?</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
