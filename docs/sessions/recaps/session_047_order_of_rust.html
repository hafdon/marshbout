Vengeance bagpipes nearly everyone awake, but Pjorg is so conspicuous in his clanging shiny plate armor that all attention focuses on him. After a bit of parlay, everyone decides he means no harm. Nevertheless, the main crew, suspicious of the possibly amnesiogenic azurite after hearing it called the &quot;Forgetting Stone,&quot; pick up their bedrolls and return to their landing above the [Strigge River].</p> <h2 id="transcript"><a href="#transcript" class="header-anchor">#</a> transcript</h2> <p><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">day 13</a> (beginning of mariner's morning watch)</p> <h3 id="pjorg"><a href="#pjorg" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pjรถrg</h3> <p>Pjorg has been underground for the last few weeks, tracing out the pattern of some ancient runes whose location he's pieces together by collecting clues and gossip relinquished to him as he's traveled across the continent. He's come down to this area even though its potention was thought to have been exhausted. The rumors were that there was still something to find of the stone runes. He's generally steered clear of people, gathering rumors from itinerant travelers and loners. At first he thought that the prevailing opinion had it right, but he eventually discovered something interesting. Pjorg isn't accustomed to being underground for this long, and has lost track of the days and nights. He'd just detected something through the walls of the cave, and had brewed up a concoction. paean to artificer path not taken. graphite, acidic exuvia from cave animal, and phosphorescent fungi, smeared it across the walls. Shining out at him, where he'd painted it, were the hints of runes he was looking for. As he peered closer, they glowed exceptionally bright, (he'd left his darkvision turned up too high), so bright that they eclipsed his vision, and he passed out.</p> <h3 id="day-14-4-am-sleeping-off-the-snake-orgy"><a href="#day-14-4-am-sleeping-off-the-snake-orgy" class="header-anchor">#</a> day 14, 4:am, sleeping off the snake orgy</h3> <p><code>[Wisdom saving throw.]</code></p> <p>(At mightnight, Flick had found a corner with a good view of the main entrance, and gone into seiza (?) and gone into a trance.) She comes out of her trance, recollecting departing Sandford, coming north up the river, being transported across the river by Gerd, but can't quite recall where she is or what happened last night. She remembers entering a face and talking with people whose faces she can't recall, having a meal, and going to sleep. She recalls the salamander, and a lizardfolk, some humans, the earthen hand that grasped Jean-Luc.</p> <p>Flick glances around her, and looks for her companions. She sees Drav, but has to take a split-second to recognize V and Jean-Luc. They have bedded down behind a low stone wall. She can hear snoring and light breathing around them in the cave. Flick steps around lightly to get a sense of who's there.</p> <p>As she sees each of the sleeping figures, she can piece together who everyone is and what role they played, and recalls the events of the evening. She sees the <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Lhaska.html">giant salamander</a> sitting next to a pile of <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/substances/azurite.html">purplish-blue crystal rods</a> she doesn't remember seeing last night. She concludes that is none of her business, further turned off by the [foul-smelling mucus] coating them.</p> <p><code>[Constitution saving throw : 9]</code></p> <p>She still doesn't feel like dry-heaving, and with her sensitive stomach, it would have caused her to throw up, but she thinks she couldn't have had that much to drink last night. And remembers that the beer was fairly watery.</p> <p>She immediately investigates for apothecary kits or something used to adulterate the drinks.</p> <p>They'd told her they were <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/substances/iridium.html#mining">iridium &gt; mining</a> for a while, and got an early start on [beer making]; the vat has quite a crust, to indicate they've been drinking it for a while; if anything it is really &quot;stanky&quot; beer. She takes a sniff for infiltration of a fungus or bacterium.</p> <p><code>[A very low perception roll]</code></p> <p>She doesn't detect a fungal presence. Because it's so close to Lhaska, her dry heat has probably prevented a lot of these harmful organisms forming in the first place. They may even have brought the beer vat with them to the cave.</p> <p>&quot;Somebody is fucking with us, but I'm not sure what I can do about it.&quot;</p> <p>She does notice that everyone in the family is wearing a [similar necklace; it looks like a gyroscope made of copper with a green patina].</p> <p><code>[History 20]</code></p> <p>She's positive that has nothing to do with clan symbols or a familiy per se. She's pretty sure it has religious or magical significance.</p> <p>V is curled up like a little spoon in JL's arms, as the latter had too much to drink. &quot;You know what, Vengeance, I know we fight a lot, but you're ok.&quot; He had said.</p> <p>They two are fairly close to each other, but Flick can reach a hand in, separate out JL, and jostle him awake. &quot;Hey JL, what do you remember about last night?&quot; He looks over at Vengeance and groans, but his recollection is as bad as Flick's. &quot;Why does it matter?&quot;</p> <p>Flick: That's all I got, too. You're no stranger to how it feels to be drunk.</p> <p>JL takes a moment to reflect and realize that he's feeling a hazy fog rather than the effects of a hangover. This isn't alcohol.</p> <p><code>[Insight]</code></p> <p>JL feels like his inability to remember the name &quot;Kriobolis&quot;. &quot;I don't have a headache -- I guess it wouldn't be the first time some nefarious group drugged me. I'm sort of against just killing them all in their sleep.&quot;</p> <p>Flick: &quot;Yeah that hadn't even occurred to me. I was thinking&quot; (she gestured to Nyuka and Lhaska) &quot;โฆ I get the feeling that, if anything is doing this to us, it's to be found in their satchel, and I was wondering if you could take the wheel.&quot;</p> <p>JL: Yeah, this is what I was made for.</p> <p><a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Nyuka.html">Nyuka</a> comes close to waking up, but he freezes in just the right way, giving her just the right touch to coax her back to sleep. She shouts &quot;Killer whales!&quot; and then falls into a deep slumber. Then he starts looking through the satchel.</p> <p>ADV to riffle through.</p> <p>Ignoring the baubles and trinkets, JL looks for drugs or poison. There are a few vials in there; he's seen some of this stuff. it's the Ys version of ecstasy. He leaves it in the satchel. He goes back and tells Flick that they bogarted the ecstasy, which is a party foul, but they could easily have killed us.</p> <p>Flick gets incredibly mad. This reminds her something that happened when she was a teen, and a bunch of the village boys tried to get her plastered in ignorance of Elven metabolism, and it went badly for them; there were broken bones, and one got lost in the woods and was never found again. It precipitated a generational feud between her family and these McmMurtons, only 2 of 3 brothers got through the night. to this day they can't be in the same area of town or they'll come to blows. Made even more awkward by the fact that it's their grandchildren and flick is still in her (relative) early 20s.</p> <p><code>[Inspiration point!]</code></p> <p>What Flick gets out of it, is that they spiked their drinks (the only frame of reference she has for this).</p> <p>JL notices how angry Flick is. From JL's perspective &quot;this is just what you do at parties: why would anyone be angry?&quot;</p> <p>Flick closes her eyes and tries to run through some meditative exercises. Would you rehearse for me the arguments that we shouldn't kill them. JL: If their intent was malicious, we would be dead or robbed, and they just gave us stuff to help us have a good time. How many parties have you been to? Flick: Not too many.</p> <p>For one of the generations, when Flick was &quot;the same age,&quot; she was a normal part of the social scene, but after they aged out, she stopped getting invited to things, so it's been a while since she's been invited to a party, and it's kindof what drove her to &quot;find her own fun&quot; in the woods.</p> <p><code>[Perception checks all around.]</code></p> <p>Drav wakes up to the sound of JL and Flick whispering conspiratorily. Pjorg wakes up to hear far down the tunnell human voices; he had thought he was alone. They might be giants. Or demons. Given his unceremonious passing out, he's still wearing all of his shit. He rolls over onto his stomach, gets up, and tries to stealth down the corridor. He's still, despite the day/many years traveling in the armor, getting used to it, makes a fair amount of noise. &quot;I'm just not as loud as I could be&quot; he thinks.  JL and Flick both hear the tinkle of metal coming down a fissure in the caves. &quot;Is this a fucking ambush&quot; flick says. JL: No. these guys have proven they're better than this. I'm not saying it shouldn't die.  Drav wakes up (again). They are looking over towards the right hand side of the caves. She remains watchful, patting V on his head. He's yelling &quot;I'm wide awake!&quot; while asleep.    DM allows V to spend 3 ki points to wake up.   Drav realizes that V's head is disturbingly active as V rouses himself. &quot;I've been awake and trying to swallow&quot; rocks which he thought were the purple-blue crystalline rocks.   20 ft. per 6 seconds, doing an exorcist crawl.   Drav desperately tries to cover V's mouth, but he's too focused and slips through her ruddy dwarven fingers.   Contested grapple check. V's perception check.   As he awake, he hears a deliciously gloppy sound. A fresh, crystalline blue turdlike object emerge from Lhaska's butthole as she burps.   Rolling initiative for everyone.    Flick sees โฆ  V: Let's not cause any commotion. I don't want to wake anyone up. I just thought we could take a few of these as a party favor or souvenir.   Lhaska turns about restlessly and settles back into sleep. Flick runs over and tries to grapple Vengeance. The memory of the boys trying to roofie Flick โฆ no! she gets Vengeance face-down in a wrestling hold.  Flick: V, can I persuade you to abandon this course of action? V: Yeah, use me like a vacuum, and I'll suck up as many of these things as possible. Flick: What if I were to put you back over where we were sleeping. V: I don't think they'll suspect a thing; you should also try to swallow as many as you can. Flick: Vengeance I want you to try to remember what happened last night. V: I don't remember much.    Drav and V both got 18s, so remember everything from last night.   Flick: You don't remember anything because they poisoned us; these azurite bars, you don't want to swallow them. (But then Flick realizes that V is lying, but can't figure out why he would be. She gives his left wrist a twist) &quot;Could you please tell me the truth, I feel like this is important.&quot; V: The important thing is we get out of here with as many of these gems as we can. F: Why is this suddenly so important to you? V: They told us last night this is one of the most powerful substances that exists. Thank god we're the only people that know about it -- now's the time to act.  Flick lets V go at this point. (It's possible they did say this and Flick can't remember.)  Scunner is in a satiated thieves' sleep, believing everything to be safe.   Drav wants to make her way very slowly to Flick and Vengeance and ask what's going on. Eldar has provided her with protection in the past; Drav does something akin to prayer to Eldar And fails an insight/religion check Drav reaches out to Eldar and feels like her spirit is more difficult to communicate with than it was in the past. It feels like she's been out over where Pjorg came came in from, and is distracted -- &quot;there's so many interesting symbols and hieroglyphs over here.&quot; and her attention is lost.</p> <p>Drav makes a loud noise and sees &quot;Glunt&quot; wake up -- the sister.</p> <p>(Sister to Haigy, daughter of Jarisma, wakes up, and looks over at the group of you).</p> <p>She sees the wrestling and the group of them, drav in the distance.</p> <p>Jean-Luc starts humming a lullaby to try to get her to fall back asleep. Vengeance reaches towards his bagpipes โฆ to accompany . She is just about to fully awake. Drav recalls blindness/deafness in Riult's spellbook? She sees Flick mouthing &quot;Mage Hand!&quot; from across the dim room, and makes it appear behind Glunt's head, like &quot;this is your mother singing a lullaby&quot;    spell attack on riult's mage and then performance check the gritty sounds of the lullaby combined with the soothing touch of invisible mage hand coaxes glunt back to sleep. JL injected a kriobolis-specific lullaby into things, maybe a GM sleeper cell sleeping song ?  Flick: I think we should bed down for the rest of the night and take things when we're clearer in the head.  Vengeance breaks off his bagpipe playing, emitting a &quot;record scratch&quot; upon seeing once of the amulets, whispering &quot;The Order of Rust!&quot; and whispers, &quot;Yes, just as I thought&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance thinks aloud, back to his stepmother [Daggonara], and her son, the wicked <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/schlonzel.html">schlonzel</a>, who wanted to join the Order of Rust, and practicing his Rust magic in a way that impressed V's father that caused V's father to favor Schlonzel even tho Schlonzel was not V's father's son.</p> <p>V Intelligence check. He believes his story. (I don't remember if this was a high or low roll)</p> <p>Pjorg continues down the hallway as quietly as possible. bringing him about to 90 feet away.   20 perception to hear what was going on in there 1d240; 225; 13 -- average. ? 120 feet away from the group when he hears this.   <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Breg.html">Breg</a> did not wake up. Vengeance is still thinking about the order of rust and his father and the wicked schlonzel and how V's father always said he should be more like him, because everything he touched turned to rust.</p> <p>V has been told he's a half-elf, but supposedly his mother was the elf. Either way, he did have a step-mother, [Daggonara], who has Schlonzel, she trained him from the time he was a little scamp in the order of rust, because that's what she wanted him to join, and by the time he grew up he was the worst person that V had ever met. Everyone loved him and thought he was amazing. (His mother, the elf, was never around). He could immediately change the properties of certain metals so they could do things like Rust slightly more quickly. (He was ionized?).    Intelligence check.   Yeah, everything he's saying totally checks out in terms of what he remembers. It's all coming together now.  Vengeane goes flat against the ground and moves his hands as though crawling, drav pushing slightly against his forehead, both of them together preventing any forward movement.  Vengeance sees a bluish-colored stone with a great deal of mucus coating it in front of him that would be great to slurp down. &quot;I'll slurp it.&quot;   Constitution check.   Vengeance swallows a brick-sized stone somehow. In the gizzard he thinks works to digest his food he thinks it will be particularly efficacious.   JL looks for a good place to hide to ambush Pjorg. JL moves to the opposite side of the room from where he's going to pop out.    Stealth 27, JL is hidden.   Flick hears the same thing, moving over to one of the low stone walls. Drav moves back. Then, without quite realizing it, Pjorg pops out into the open room. to his right are 4 sleeping humans, up and to the right a huge salamander with a pile of gems and another lizardfolk behind it sleeping; directly ahead of him (80 feet away; it's lit from the salamander) a monk face-down on the rocks who looks like he's trying to eat more rocks. and at the edge of his vision, a few more figures in the far distance. (Drav manages to hide! a historic day! Eldar swooped back to Drav to cover her up.)  Pjorg, having stumbled into this room full of people, knows that something weird has happened. Are there rocks that HE can get behind. He thinks that his rhythms aren't synchronized with those of these people, whoever they are.</p> <p><code>[a very bad stealth check?]</code></p> <p>Drav, as Eldar rushed back, she scintillated against a bunch of foreign armor, and the sparks of her spirit passage make clear that there's a goblinoid hiding behind the rocks.   JL sees the entrance and attempt to hide of a goblin fully outfitted in gilded plate armor carrying a very large battle axe who ducks down behind some rocks quite obviously, and even V notices.   JL insight as to his intentions. It's weird that he walked into the room and hid.    He's kind of baffled. (But Pjorg is also pretty baffled) &quot;He's hiding in โฆ the rocksโฆ&quot;    Raw intelligence Flick, Drav remember -- Flick can kind fo feel it, Drav remembers that Fundi was talking about establishing a hallowed ground , so it's consecreated ground; the specific effect is that everyone in the circle can communicate even if they can't speak the same language, which they were told was to talk to Ruhu, but it lets them talk to the lizardfolk and brittle.   During the party, Brittle was all &quot;Get Smashed!&quot;  JL is so confident that he blends totally into the shadows, gliding like a ghost next to Flick; Flick is actually surprised when he comes up next to her. Pjorg has no idea. JL's breath moves one of her stray curls. JL inwardly curses that it wasn't perfect. Flick feels for a moment the raw sexuality felt by Nyuka with JL earlier.  Flick, &quot;are you watching that goblin too? he doesn't seem to mean any harm. should we โฆ see what he wants?&quot; JL: &quot;Also, who wanders into a mining cave โฆ by accident?&quot; Flick: &quot;Remember when you wandered into the death-knight's naked wrestling circle.&quot;    Perception rolls</p> <p>Flick notices that the armor of the creature is slightly dulled by a patina of dust. Vengeance: &quot;dust, or โฆ RUST?!?!&quot; Flick: He is armed to the teeth, but he's not ready for burgling. he can't be here to take advantage of us. Vengeance: he kindof remeinds me of someone. Do you remember our friend Fez we left for dead at that snake hospital?   We discuss whether or not Vengeance can even see Pjorg. he fails a stealth check so hard.   The guy on the floor pulls out his bagpipes and Frampton comes alive it.  V: &quot;Do you remember Fez?&quot;  Drav desperately regrets giving Vengeance a little breathing room.</p> <p>JL agrees with Flick that this goblin is probably not here for something nefarious. As V's bagpipes fill the air with cacophony, Flick concludes all the people are about to wake up. She uses Fleet of Foot Both Scunner and Lhaska wake up at this point. Lhaska, being a huge salamander, looks over to Nyuka and licks her. Scunner wakes up, and immediately sees Pjorg after being awoken by the bagpipe. and he nudges Breg: &quot;we've got a newcomer here. Looks to be alone.&quot;  Drav stays hidden with her unprecedented 17 stealth. ready to cast a spell if needed.</p> <p>Flick has a full rest, everyone else has the equivalent of 2 short rests.</p> <p>Drav rolls for Eldar. She feels the spirit of Eldar infusing her; because she's sitting on the cave floor, she can see the rocks crawl up her and disguise her; once per long rest she can make a stealth check with advantage if she's still and touching rock or stone.</p> <p>[Glunt] rolls a nat 1, so she stays asleep, but the other three do wake up. she remains fully out of it. the other three are disoriented, but awoke from bagpipe music.   Haigy, the one who attended the same charter school that JL did.   They were awoken by the bagpipe, but only see Pjorg, and respond to Scunner's shout. They, shout, &quot;Is this one of the Hat Baskets? They know that this Azurite is ours -- we only had a deal with them for the Iridium.&quot; and they start gathering up their weapons โฆ</p> <p>[Brittle] looks at what's going on and goes back to sleep. Pjorg, it's clear almost everyone has seen him glinting in the soft orange light from Lhaska.</p> <p>Pjorg: Greetings, small ones, and appropriately sized lizars! My name is Pjorg Tallheart! Scunner: Is that it?   Roll for Introduction. (Persuasion) -- 11 I mean you no harm! (which is true) (he looks like a moderately sized piece of fools gold) &quot;I am embarrassingly slightly lost in this cave and was awoken by the sound of squabbling voices.  The humans closest to him look at him scepticaly. FUndi , the elder is closest, and they are all kind of giggling behind him.   &quot;I do not mean to appear threatening. Is it the battle axe that I hold in my extremely large hands? or is it the greataxe strapped to my extremely large back&quot;  Fundi: young boy, dn't you see the ribbon we've established . this is a itual circle, you can't just come in here. in fact, let me know about anyone you've had sex with who wasn't married to you. this is of paramount importance.   Pjorg: I am adept at reading multiple scripts and would ahve noticed signage to this effect in the hallway. and would ahve noticed such a warning.  Fundi looks around himself, realizes he's telling the truth, reaches into a fanny pack and pulls out a ribbon and ties it to the stone just to his left and strings it across in front of you. Flick: that is ;very ;unfair ex post facto ordinancing! Fundi: As you can see there is a ribbon here and you may cross it by no means and you can't cross it unless you answer my questions to see if you'll corrupt this ritual space. Pjorg: that sounds totally reasonable except for your placing of the ribbon at this time. Fundi: To be honest, I hadn't known there was an entrance from this direction and otherwise I would ahve placed it here earlier. As you can see, I've placed one where accidental visitors might have entered and had to be allowed forwards after answering the questions. Ruhu excuse us all. Pjorg (to himself) &quot;not the true โฆ order of rust.&quot; &quot;I can answer your question in one simple statement of phrase.&quot; and he shows Fundi the rune on his shield. [The rune looks like a burning half of a cursive letter f] Flick shouts: It's the poon rune, am I right, up top! V: there better be some Poon-itive action.   Galen gets his only ever inspiration point.</p> <p>Pjorg isn't invoking it, he's just showing it to him.    <code>[Intimidation 8]</code></p> <p>Pjorg: You see the shield symbolizes protection, what one must always use, but i have protection because of the celibacy oath that my order swears. Fundi takes a look. It appears to just make the shield weaker where it's been carved. but if you do subscribe to an oath of celibacy then you are welcome across the ribbon. Flick feels almost ontologically embarrassed by her attempt to make the pun. She flashed back to times at the Dacha where none of her humor was appreciated.  Flick: Elven jokes are really long because they live for so long; they are like shaggy dog stories, and this 20 minute long joke that ends with โฆ a chief was going to have a baby, and the warriors had to get hippopotamus hide, and a pythagorus joke. JL is the only one who hears Flick whispering this to herself. Vengeance: Did you hear the one about the three elves wandering through the woods where the foo creature lives? JL is so annoyed that he sighs so loud he comes out of stealth. &quot;Flick for the love of Ruhu shut up with these stories.&quot; and then he realizes where he is . and the entire famiy turns to look at him.</p> <p>[2:02]  Breg walks out into the center of things, rubbing literal grit from her eyes which accumulates as she sleeps. &quot;Everybody quiet down what the hell is going on here. Why isn't everyone asleep? This is perfect sleeping weather for a dwarf.&quot;  Pjorg (in dwarven): is it perfect sleeping weather? I'm disoriented in this underground space. Breg: Oh, a member of the tribes. I see that Fundi has already allowed you into the hallowed circle. Please introduce yourself. Pjorg: I am, once again, Pjorg the Tallhearted, which is โฆ we usually leave out the &quot;the&quot;. The tallhearted clan, i've not heard of them. Breg: is the tallhearted a dwarven clan? Pjorg: you can probably detect my accent . I've only learned the formal forms. Breg: you must have studied from a religious text with the older grammar and syntax. Come in, it's not even clear to me where you've come from.  Lhaska starts 'barking' very loudly.  Pjorg: Did I hear someone mention Azurite, the blood of the titan Azuroth? Breg: I've never heard it called under that name, but yes, Azurite, for sure. Pjorg: Oh, I've conflated it with a different Azurite. Breg: You may also know that it's called The Forgetting Stone. Pjorg: That may explain why I can't determine how long I've been underground. Breg: Yes, how close have you been to us? Pjorg: That, too, remains unclear to me. I was searching for โฆ something? But the journey led me. All these corridors kind of look the same. Breg: Well yes they've been carved out over thousands of years by the action of the water. I'm surprised you're still alive, as there's not much to eat down here. Pjorg: not luck as some but luckier than many. Breg: that's very vague. I like to be literally and figuratively concrete. (She still can't locate drav in the cave.) No matter, I'm sure she's asleep. Dwarves are very good sleepers.   Flick realizes that hostilities aren't going to commence, so she steps out into the open. V: Everyone relax, everything should be fine. (He cocks his self-killer and throws it at Jarisma to cut the necklace off her neck. He uses all of his hatred of Schlonzel to focus his attack.)    He rolls a 5.   V pulls his selfkiller out and tosses it towards the <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/ruhu_family.html">Ruhu family</a>. With the extra grease he's been crawling through it sorts of slides out of his hand along the floor towards them.   Insight for the Ruhu family.   Jarisma and Glunt, the daughter, who was asleep: &quot;This asshole is trying to attack us!&quot; Haigy looks sympathetic, &quot;Hold on, I think he's just hungover. This is just some kind of drinking game he's a part of.&quot; Glunt and <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Jarisma.html">Jarisma</a> are making their way towards him to teach him a lesson.   Drav finally comes out of stealth, standing in front of rocks, and runs over to restrain Vengeance again. Drav just manages to smash Vengeance's head ungently into the cave floor while shouting out an apology. &quot;Sorry we're still working on him. Just โฆ &quot; she shrugs. They look sympathetic and cast an eye back towards Haigy. &quot;You sure you got him? We've had to deal with the same sort of thing with this guy. Hormones at their age, right?&quot; And then they exchange looks with each other because Vengeance is rapidly losing his hair. But they relax with Drav in control.   JL, operating on the assumption they are not going to attack Vengeance, stays hidden.</p> <p>Nyuka: Has everyone been woken up by this goblin? Flick: Yes. Pjorg: I'm ;notresponsible for the vast majority of the commotion. I was awoken by commotion of my own. Nyuka: Fundi, did you offer him opportunity to answer the question? Fundi: yes, he answered with flying colors, and I've pushed the ropes down for him, but he hasn't offered anything as far as libations or victuals are concerned. Nyuka: I'm not in the mood right now anyway, just make sure he stays quiet. (She looks at her satchel quizzically and settles back to sleep)  Flick; What's happened here is a bit strange; hopefully we can stay friends after this; this tallhearted goblin means us no harm; let's finish the night's rest, and then tomorrow we can all head back. Breg: I'm fine with that โฆ arrangements.   The humans come towards Pjorg with [thick twists of tobacco]. We're all just people living in a cave. Jarisma: well we do want to get out of here. JL: Man, you guys worry too much. They look at him a bit sceptically ; in return he takes a huge puff of the blunt. Jarisma slaps him on the back heartily, All right, yeah, you're a steady one, I'll fall in line with that. They start telling each other clan-related stories. Maybe a few tales about their lineage.</p> <p>Pjorg refuses to join the circle and goes sitting off by himself.  JL is too baked to avoid Vengeance.</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/hafdon/obsidian-general/edit/mac/marshbout/sessions/recaps/session_047_order_of_rust.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help improve the page?</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
