She had been visited by fantods and hallucinations; she remembered stepping into the Ethereal Plan where she was beset by sleep paralysis.</p> <p><strong>THOUGHTBACK</strong></p> <p>Flick wonders why <a href="/marshbout/creatures/adventurers.html">The Adventurers</a> were willing to ditch their &quot;stinky fish paladin&quot; <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Fezziwig_Hornswoggle.html">Fez</a> at the first sign of trouble, but have made accommodations for their &quot;stinky fish <a href="/marshbout/factions/monk.html">monk</a>&quot; <a href="/marshbout/creatures/vengeance.html">vengeance</a>. The <a href="/marshbout/creatures/species/elf.html">elf</a> suspects <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Startrella.html">Startrella</a> to be pursuing a pro--Fish-Monk-Vengeance, anti-Fish-Paladin-Fez agenda.</p> <p><strong>THE MIND-PRESENT</strong></p> <p>Occasionally Pilzzt's face will spasm in what could only be pain, although her body appears completely healed. (However, it's difficult for these humanoids to see physical injury to a <a href="/marshbout/creatures/species/starchild.html">Starchild</a>.)</p> <p><a href="/marshbout/creatures/Pjorg.html">Pjorg</a> really likes to read runes and maybe can't read anything that's not runes. Instead of going to the library he would like to complete the enmagication<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> of his axe. Or do squats in the stacks.</p> <p>Pjorg remembers that when the demon was defeated, all the crystalline parts it had left behind melted into a <a href="/marshbout/ontology/substances/crystal-demon_blood-plasma.html">creamy milky sanguineous<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> substance</a>. Undeterred, Pjorg sets off on an investigative mission around the house to find any remaining pieces of crystal.</p> <p>Flick, thinking back to the <a href="/marshbout/creatures/corrupted_elder_brain.html">corrupted elder brain</a>, the bug, the pillar, the <a href="/marshbout/creatures/species/kelris.html">evil fish creatures</a>, the pirates, how abnormal was this crystal creature. Flick can tell after the fact that this was an unprecedented event and not a commonplace nuisance.</p> <p>When Drav had cast Shatter, part of the creature's hide must have been ejected because Pjorg discovers a goliath-thumb-sized nugget embedded in a pod wall, undissolved, and covered by the <a href="/marshbout/items/TidySheets_tm.html">life-support film</a>. <code>WIS save.</code></p> <p>(At the same time, Pjorg realizes that he doesn't have to worry about any long-term effects of being swaddled in that film last night.)</p> <p>When his eye alights upon the crystal, he hears faintly the same cozening words heard by the others: &quot;Guard me!&quot; He feels connected to a different energy source, something communicating with him through telepathy, or maybe conversing directly with his intruition somehow, and he knows somehow innately that this crystal will dissolve if he exposes it to the air and that he needs to preserve it in its casing if he's to prevent that.</p> <p>The only way to keep something guarded, Pjorg thinks, is to keep it with you at all times; otherwise something can be broken into, or stolen, or I don't know you could have your entire life taken away from you by a spell that makes you tiny.</p> <p>For a moment Flick reflects on her own flirtation with murder hobation when she &quot;liberated&quot; a pair of gloves and rope from a farmer's shed.</p> <p>Pjorg, with his background as a clan(?) crafter, knows how to work stone, and can also speak Dwarven, having been trained by dwarves. He uses his chisel and hammer and tries to take as little of the wall with him as possible.</p> <p>Flick reflects on the cosmopolitanism of Ys, where Drav was raised by elves, Pjorg trained with dwarves, Flick was raised by humans, and Vengeance was raised by fish-loving idiots.</p> <p>Pjorg personally doesn't know how he's going to keep the film and pod wall an intact coccoon once he removes it from the wall; the film seems particularly delicate. Furthermore, laminating the pod wall will be difficult without puncturing it.</p> <p>Pjorg learned a technique from the dwarves, which is akin to using a liquid metal (specifically a mercury alloy as a lifting agent, so you go underneath the thing you want to remove and inject it in behind so it raises the proximal layer, which makes it much easier to remove without piercing through the substrate).</p> <p>Pjorg is concerned with how he's going to protect the gem: Look at what happened to all the other gems! These fools allowed them to dissolve. He's not going to let the same thing happen to this one, so tries as much as possible to be out of the way.</p> <p>Startrella and Miriana are unaware of Pjorg, talking with the rest of the group, who by now have decided on going <em>somewhere</em> next, although where, exactly, is still being hotly debated.</p> <p>This is the only thing Pjorg does that is remotely delicate and, that being the case, he proceeds carefully and takes his time; if he gets the feeling that it's about to go sideways he will leave the gem in place. He produces a syringe from his pack</p> <p>In the process he learns more about the makeup of these walls: they are laminated and can be separated into distinct layers.</p> <p>He separates the layers of the wall like filo dough, and manages to excavate the ggem with the pod's protective film wrapping around it.</p> <p>The film looks like it's about to creep up over his body, but something in him (like his con save from last night) prevents that.</p> <p>Pjorg takes that whole cocooned piece, and stores it in a hard box in his pack.</p> <p>Miriana says she can keep Vengeance under the table. It almost looks torturous, but he seems to be enjoying it.</p> <p>Flick: Yeah that's our vengeance.</p> <p>They look outside and Dorf is asleep alongside of the front of the &quot;house&quot;</p> <p>miriana: it gets too narrow down by the library to take a dragon, and you'll probably have to walk. Let me give you these. She walks over to the pod &quot;controls&quot; and moves her hands over the bumps. The pods are sucked down into bowl-shaped concavities in the floor.</p> <p>Miriana: if you want to step into here, it will make it easier to walk outside.</p> <p><code>Check to see if she notices anything weird about the wall. No.</code></p> <p>She offers them to step into these little inverted hemispheres.</p> <p>Flick &quot;what exactly are you asking?&quot;</p> <p>Miriana: Just step in that little cavity there and it should cover your feet and prevent you from sinking when you're outside.</p> <p>There are forces here that pull us upwards and others from the planet that pull us down, and these boots are more influenced by the upwards force than the downwards one.</p> <p>Jaap: Are there any known side effects to using these?</p> <p>Miriana: Did you say &quot;gnome&quot; side effects?</p> <p>Jaap: Exactly.</p> <p>Miriana: Not a gnome, but there was a dwarf a while ago that I saw put them on, to no immediate ill effect. You'd probably have to ask an &quot;expert&quot; for.</p> <p>Jaap: Ok, I feel a bit relieved, that's what I wanted to know for now.</p> <p>Jaap steps into the concavitt, which shapes itself to his feet and rises to about knee-height (for a gnome). it then begins to separate from the rest of the wall of the house, forming a little peduncle, which then snaps off from the house. He's wearing these tarnsparent blue bootiesl he notices immediately that he's a little lighter on his feet, hovering (possible for him in the boots).</p> <p>Jaap tries to hover higher. By jumping. <code>Acrobatics</code> Jaap gets the hang of the boots pretty quicky. He leaps upwith relative ease, fairly high, and falls gently back down the ground. It's a little difficult to stick the landing, since it's almost like trying to keep an airhockey puck still, but as a gnome he has experience with navigating treacherous terrain. He rights himself and keeps his feet from sliding. It doesn't appear as though he has any telepathic connection to it, however.</p> <p>There is a little swoosh on there?</p> <p><code>The DM is forced to use a webcam as a hand-held mic.</code></p> <p>Jaap <code>Investigates with disadvantage</code> after &quot;using the facilities&quot;.</p> <h3 id="flick-s-trancedream-suddenly-remembered"><a href="#flick-s-trancedream-suddenly-remembered" class="header-anchor">#</a> Flick's trancedream, suddenly remembered</h3> <p>Flick, last night while trance dreaming, did see a figure. It was not a nighthag. But it was humanoid, draped in copious bolts of fabric, perhaps with a delicate embroidery along the edge. They held a tall white staff with a fiery ball of darkness at the top, which looked almost like the peak of an eclipse. (but shedding darkness - making things darker around itself)</p> <p>The figure began to vibrate slightly, the vibrations becoming so pronounced that at times it appeared to be three separate figures. Or two. Or one. They overlapped each other while remaining separate. The amplitude and frequency of the vibrations calmed, and, like when the eyes find focus on an object, and they steadied into a single form, she awoke.</p> <p>Flick recalls that the emotional tenor of this visitation was creepy, but somehow calming, despite the visual frenzy. She got the feeling that the outer buzzing was in contrast to an inner calm.</p> <p>Flick found the figure completely unfamiliar, but it would have been nearly impossible to tell.</p> <p>It seemed like the Ethereal Plan, but she wasn't sure if she was there or just dreaming she was thereโฆ</p> <p>Was the figure distressed or beseeching? There was no beseeching, but she notice that the hand that held the staff and the bearing was that of an elf, and that it looked ontologically unhoused. It would seem creepy and out of place pretty much anywhere. It seemed to her like the tales of <a href="/marshbout/creatures/barabas.html">Barabas the Wandering Horizon Walker</a> that she had heard about from Gonfalon. Flick takes her visions very seriously.</p> <p>Flick thinks to herself about the <a href="/marshbout/factions/sia-cret-service.html">Sia-cret Service</a>, and compares that to the absence of &quot;police&quot; and deep state -- they don't seem big on law enforcement.</p> <h3 id="speaking-of-civil-service-buildings"><a href="#speaking-of-civil-service-buildings" class="header-anchor">#</a> Speaking of civil service buildings</h3> <p>The gang heads towards the &quot;library&quot;, still unsure as to whether it's a private collection, a public one, or if there is any difference like that to be made on Si'a.</p> <p>They pass through the town, which start to get denser. Some of the houses pile on each other here like a ballpit at mcdonalds, or a bunch of balls scooped out and dumped in someone's sack.</p> <p>At times they have to crawl through the convexly curved edge geometries exposed when circles come into contact with one another.</p> <p>Flick doesn't string up her bow, in part because she's too cramped, but recalls their mixed history in dense urban environments.</p> <p>The people who put on boots:</p> <p>Jaap, Jean-Luc, Pjorg, Flick</p> <p>The people who did not:</p> <p>Drav (she's ) tromping [tronking?] through the street, coughing and climbing over [inaudible]</p> <p>Flick matches Drav's pace, taking a position &quot;at 7o'clock&quot; to cover her left rear flank. She's not walking backwards &quot;like a weirdo&quot;, but she doesn't feel at ease when stuff gets this dense.</p> <p>They don't encounter any starfolk on their specific path, but they can see the shadows of the passage of others on parallel routes.</p> <p>They do occasionally pop out into a kind of clearing, with the adjoining bubbles forming a spheroid shape flattened on the polar axis.</p> <p>In these spaces they see starchildren gathered in small groups, chatting with one another. Others seem to be creating shapes out of light , free-standing, persistence sculptures made of light.</p> <p>To Flick it seems like (entertainment, social, religious, solemn โฆ) <code>Insight from casual observation</code> After passing through a couple of the Polariton (plural) Flick is able to distinguish those who are passing the time, those who are solemn, and occasionally ne'er-do-wells: persons who interfere with others' light sculptures #need-name and change the structure, or introduce graffiti; the light appears to be malleable. <code>DM wonders if it would be cooler if they were very brittle, or like cotton, or a natural material</code> Some of the ligatures take a great amount of focus, which the initial light-artists #need-name exemplify as they crouch down, face taking on what they've discovered is the aspect of a concentrating starchild: where the outer flesh of the head and neck becomes almost translucent and a deep blue smoke, emitted from within base of the neck, flowing like the smoke from an extinguished candle, seems to sink into the body and disappear. But their body also appears to be contorted in concentation.</p> <p>As they look on, it becomes clear that some sort of fight is about to erupt, as one of the sculptors unfolds themself and says something in an angry tone to a graffitist.</p> <p>Flick stares as long as she reasonably can to see what the shit happens with this lightform. She sees that the one who crouched over stands, and they see a thin whispy umbilicus stretch from their hand to a branch of the sculpture. It almost looks like the umbilicus is pumping into the sculpture, and as it does it stains the bright blue-white form a dark red like ink dropped into water.</p> <p>It looks like it's getting Livid.</p> <p>Even the little adventitious ligatures react mischievously, leaping from one filigreed attachment point to another, or being sucked into the skeleton of the other only to pop out in a different place moments later.</p> <p>The starfolk who started this has a wry smile on their face, and puts his hands up in a mock plea, as though to say they are just kidding, there's no need to get angry.</p> <p>The sculptor grumbles, keeping their hands close to their body, turn around, and sucks the sculpture back into their body, its corporeal form taking on the much more intense white-blue of the art piece. It then disperses through the body and disappears.</p> <p>Jaap is also watching; the almost-illusion is up his alley. He asks Startrella if non-starchildren can learn how to do this too?</p> <p>Startrella: At one time Si'a was known for that, or it was an artist's retreat, or destination, and people would come to learn to paint with light like that.</p> <p>Flick: Toe Maskin-Cade ? He's famously a starchild.</p> <p>Startrella: I don't know that I ever met him, but it sounds like that exact sort of thing. Before I left, it was all the rage, but it used to be a talent that the starchildren could offer to others; it wasn't exhausted in the way that our other powers now are.</p> <p>Jaap: Could I learn it?</p> <p>Startrella: If you have the aptitude. Anyone can โฆ <em>start</em> to do it, but even for experts it's guestwork to predict who will end up being successful. You'll hear of a half-elf who came to Si'a and their mentor was like, don't even try, you're terrible, and then ten years later they become a huge celebrity in light-painging, and they'll go on the circuit and tell them the story, don't listen to your teathers, trust yourself.</p> <p>Jaap: โฆ so..</p> <p>Startrella: well it takes a long time to learn, and at first you can only perform it while you're here.  I'll look out for one of the experts I know: they wear a thin strip of light hanging down from their neck, and it's just wrapped around itself, and hanging down, and you're like, god, they're so pretentious , but that's the sort of person we're looking for.</p> <p>Jaap: Sure, sounds good. He thinks to himself how he is kind of a dilettante anyway so he doesn't mind dabbling.</p> <p>Startrella: There is dabbling here too; there is a kind of guild here so you might have to go with a guild; but sometimes the experts will go outside the system and take on an outsider to kind of flex about how good they are.</p> <p>Before long, Startrella appears to be checking a kind of internal map: she looks straight up into the sky occasionally, perhaps to get her bearings; it's likely she's sensitive to the polarity of light or the field-lines of a magnetic force.</p> <p>Flick just sees bubble houses ahead, bubble houses behind.</p> <p>Before long they arrive at an incongruous structure. Instead of the nice smooth contoured outlines, occasionally flat-edged projections poke out from the surface colored a medium grey and of an unknown substance, almost as though a cut diamond were peeking out of a water droplet.</p> <p>Startrella: Yep, this is what Mariana described. It's a local archivist. What did she say their name was? Blez or Blev? I mean we can ask them. I think it's Blez.</p> <p>Flick: Like Blez hPasq'ell? probably some weird starchild spelling.</p> <p>star: Yeah she said they hate it when you say &quot;Hashtag Blezzed&quot; so I'd recommend taking a different approach if any of you had that in mind.</p> <h3 id="hashtag-blezzed"><a href="#hashtag-blezzed" class="header-anchor">#</a> Hashtag Blezzed</h3> <p>Jean-Luc <code>(82)</code>: What he knows as &quot;hashtag&quot; is a thieves' cant sign you can put on a house, essentially  ^^ ? next to each other ; a single one ^ ? means that the person might have a job for a hobo, but ^^ means they might give you a real job and continue to work with you -- a friend of the underworlders and the dispossessed.</p> <p>Flick for some reason thinks about how freaked out she would be to see thieves' cant etchings on Si'a.</p> <p>Jean-Luc can't read them but there have definitely been markings on some houses.</p> <p>Drav knows &quot;hashtag&quot; is shorthand for an alchemical symbol; it looks like a circle with squiggles inside, and indicates that the substance or element deals with &quot;intoxication&quot; as a state of being. it's the synthesis of the synthesis and antithesis of drunkenness.</p> <p>It's usally seen in the context of an alchemical equation. Drav looks consideringly at the house.</p> <p>Jaap, hashtag is a malody from which gnomes suffer. Its etiology is unknown, but it causes the gnomes to look like varts. (One of the types of creatures that Rovine/Raxivort would appear to as a god in the temples of Xanthuc)</p> <p>It's not known how to cure it; people seek out various remedies, witch doctors or hedge witches, shamans and clerics; Jaap saw a case that he was unable to cure. Sometimes the cases remediate apparently spontaneously, and then everyone will vie for credit. It's on the border between magic and charlatanism. Sometimes people are suspected to do it to themselvves, in order to garner pity or care, or accuse someone else of being an evil sorcerer.</p> <p>Flick knows 'hashtag' as a simple cantrip (create light) that she was taught. Gonfalon tried to teach it to flick, but she could only manage it when in physical contact with Gonfalon. Which always creeped her out. He was just a creepy guy.</p> <p>Looking back on it Flick starts to re-evaluate how some parts of her childhood were kind of weird. The word that accompanied the cantrip kind of sounded like hashtag. And even, it was in deepspeech, and the light was kind of greyish-purple; it didn't look like the good version of the spell. It always felt incongrous in the forest.</p> <p>Pjorg, &quot;hashtag&quot; is a rune for poison; it indicates that he can cause something to deal or prevent poison damage.</p> <p>Pjorg doesn't say anything about this aloud, because you don't say anything out loud about poison; it's impolite. The polite thing to do is just poison them.</p> <p>Pjorg might even be a little offended; there's a class of runes you're not supposed to say their name, and this is one of them, so it comes as quite a shock that Startrella.</p> <p>The Tetragrammatron [sic] . The group of four runes.</p> <p>Well anyway Startrella approaches this building, which unlike all the others doesn't have the kind of airlock as the others but appears to have a door, or a large flat face of one of the cubic protrusions.</p> <p><code>DC 16 saving throw in weakest stat. The DM gets tomatoes thrown at him. Everyone rolls extremely well except Drav who fails her Dex throw.</code></p> <p>Drav flashes to an alternate univers in which she trips over a bunch of rakes, and then is approached romantically by a lewd &quot;gentleman&quot;.</p> <p>Drav has seen her companions slipping and sliding after they put on her boots; she was feeling pretty confident; she sees herself as grounded; she's a Dwarf connected to the earth, even if that means crawling over alley garbage, and as she approaches the house she feels her feet slide back and forth. She slides such that she has to put her hand out to avoid colliding with the wall.</p> <p>Where her hand makes contact she feels a greasy, freezing cold slime or biofilm. Draw pulls her hand away quickly, shaking it, looking at it. but the damage has been done: the slime, sticking to it, flies off. Drav thrusts her hand into her pocket in an effort to warm it up; the skin returns to a normal temperature quickly when not in contact with the grease.</p> <p>Flick doesn't think quickly enough, but she does like interesting substances that can be made into poisons, so she starts reaching for a tincture bottles, but by the time she tries to locate it in the swirling gas mound that is the ground, it's gone. Lucky for her, the entire structure and small peripherum [^ periphery].</p> <p><code>Investigation/Perception checks.</code></p> <p>Flick and Jaap don't see this, but Startrella asks Drav what happened.</p> <p>As she says this, they look at Drav, and where the pieces land. Jean-Luc and Pjorg witnessed Drav slide into the wall.</p> <p>What looked like a grey coloration is being caused by this grease. It doesn't seem to be able to migrate onto the traditional bubble-house wall material. #plothole They kind of guess that the cubic parts are made of the same material, it's just that they look different because the slime is discoloring and dissolving the flat faces and sharp edges.</p> <p>Drav asks Startrella what's going on.</p> <p>&quot;I don't actually know.&quot; Miriana mentioned that there's been some experimentation going on with new architectural features, so I was expecting these bubble-bits. I don't know about the grease, though. Does anyone else feel chilly?</p> <p>the grease's cold makes startrella fearless-ish (it's like toxoplasmosis), which is why she reaches out to touch the wall.</p> <p>Anyone close enough to the house feels the chill as well. Flick ran over to Drav as soon as she reacted in pain, but Drav is shiffling away carefully. Flick sees the reddened skin, and shouts for Startrella to not touch it, but incoherently: &quot;Bad thing!&quot;</p> <p>Startrella: No, that's ok. I assumed I'd be able to open it the way we usually do, without touching it. But Flick makes a great point, no one touch the wall.</p> <p>Anyone further than 5 feet doesn't feel the cold. Jaap inches closer and holds his hands out as if up to a flame.</p> <p>He is not injured, but as he gets closer and feels the cold sink into him; even on Si'a his connection to Garl has been weaker, but as he approaches the house he feels Garl's presence weaken further, not entirely, but it feels like it's trying to fight its way through a void or non-space. &quot;There's a little interference on the airwaves.&quot; But more than that; being stuck between two radio channels.</p> <p>#comment<br>
&lt;!--</p> <p>Maybe the outer-creatures are using the Repeller force in order to learn how to create void homes (both of matter and magic) for themselves in regular areas.</p> <p>--&gt;</p> <p>Pjorg thinks of Naan the bread as a logical concept.</p> <h3 id="startellis"><a href="#startellis" class="header-anchor">#</a> Startellis</h3> <p>Jaap looks for a stick or something non-thermoconductive with which to touch the wall. He sees a (star)trellis left over from growing their farms, with dessicated barnacle-like growths clinging to it; they appear to have been cocoons or egg-sacs or something similar. He picks that up and pokes the wall.</p> <p>The greasy substance spreads and thickens around the point that makes contact with the wall. It pulls away like taffy when he pulls the stick away. As the space between them widens, he can see condensation forming merely from the atmospheric moisture.</p> <h3 id="jean-luc-the-real-estate-agent"><a href="#jean-luc-the-real-estate-agent" class="header-anchor">#</a> Jean-Luc the real-estate agent</h3> <p>Definately cold, he thinks to himself. Perhaps there's a use for this as a <a href="/marshbout/items/refrigerant_goop.html">refrigerant_goop</a>.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: Startrella, are there a lot of โฆ cold beverages here? Is this place used like a refrigerator?</p> <p>Startrella: I've never seen this used to cool beverages; we don't really drink all that much except for the milk, and there are traditional ways of preparing it, of which this grease is not a part.</p> <p>Jean-Luc denies the opportunity to learn more about the &quot;traditional ways of preparing milk-based goods&quot;. However, as a former real-estate agent, he's curious about the plumbing in how this works, because he thinks there would be a market for this back in Marshbout or Kriobolis.</p> <p><code>Jean-Luc makes an Investigation check. 20.</code></p> <p>He remembers the exchange in <a href="/marshbout/locations/plaza_of_the_two_otters.html">Two Otters Plaza</a> and thinks that the market potential for milk-based products is very good, if he could get it between the two at all efficiently.</p> <p>Startrella reaches out the door, concentrating hard to open it. The flat door suddenly bulges outward slightly, then rebounds and bulges into the house, like a vacillating diaphragm. The frequency of this systole and diastole make it quite clear that the door is <em>trying</em> to form a curved shape, but its only stable shape is flat.</p> <p>The door vacillates back and forth, and then suddenly the the flat door becomes a very dark grey with pink and red flecks โฆ or veinsโฆ ? The grease then falls as though a curtain fell, and then see heaped folds of the grease spreading slowly over the lintel.</p> <p>Looking inside, there is very little ambient light; it's much darker than any of the other houses they've been in. There's a grey-pink hue to the entire room as light is diffused through the grease on the walls.</p> <p>The gang follows Startrella in.</p> <h3 id="inside-the-archives"><a href="#inside-the-archives" class="header-anchor">#</a> Inside the Archives</h3> <p><code>In these dim light conditions, Jean-Luc will have disadvantage on Perception checks which rely on sight. Dim light = lightly obscured.</code></p> <p>&quot;One more screwdriver on the swiss army knife that is Flick Brianniel,&quot; Flick announces to no one in particular.</p> <p><code>Roll initiative.</code></p> <p>Jean-Luc feels as though he's stepping into a giant bear claw. He shows up for initiative, it's felt.</p> <p>Flick for some reason is feeling really out of it (a very low initiative score).</p> <p>Where there are cubular structures on the outside, they connect like girders to a corresponding piece somewhere on the other side of the building. At first glance they appear to have been randomly inserted through the walls, like the children's game of kerstick-and-kerstuck. (Flick reflects on how &quot;Kerplunk&quot; was another cantrip that Gonfalon never managed to teach her. She always meant to get the information out of him, but it never transpired.)</p> <p>For the most part, the light is created by the grease that's coating the walls, and the grey, veinous networks, like pink cracks, shelves. They are not flowing or throbbing; rather, they are frozen so any motion, if it ever existed, has ceased.</p> <p>The shelves and all the books on them are also coated with a thin layer of the same grease.</p> <p>Flick (munching some <a href="/marshbout/items/dried_scuttercrab_claws.html">dried_scuttercrab_claws</a>, which muffles her words somewhat) says : Looks like we won't find that book we were looking for.</p> <p>The grease does not resemble that in Pilzzt's house. Jaap can't tell -- all goops are beginning to look the same to him, by this point.</p> <p>Their breath freezes into frost clouds as soon as they step inside, at which point they also feel the temperature plummet painfully.</p> <p>Flick is briefly reminded of the temperature at the base of  <a href="/marshbout/locations/goblinsmite_peak.html">Goblinsmite Peak</a> (in an alternate universe where they made it there) and she thinks of Aphelia and briefly wonders about her and whether she's safe.</p> <p>Flick doesn't know why, but feels like she's <em>not</em> ok, all of a sudden. Flick is actively not connecting the dots that nothing back on Ys is probably doing well.</p> <p><code>Perception checks all around.</code></p> <p>Jean-Luc, because of his experience feeling his way through blindingly smoky taverns, where he could barely see the chair next to him due to all the slakesmoke being puffed out by the increasing number of smokers in Kriobolis.</p> <p>As a real-estate agent, a lot of deals took place in these smoke-filled rooms. Even a few times he'd tried flipping a tavern, but getting the slakesmoke smell out proved nearly impossible.</p> <p>Jaap, due to his just generally heightened perceptivity, the time he spent underground, and the between-the-radio-stations feeling he was and is having is originating from the rear of the room. At first he thnks it's a series of shelves stacked so they are running vertically,vut it then because clear to him that that it's a huge frozen monster. He waves at it.</p> <p><code>Stealth Check. Drav eats it. They all do worse than the Librarian.</code></p> <p>Drav continues to trip over some of the gardening implements which were scattered alongside the bit of trellis. Now that she thinks about it, too, when she touched the site of the building she felt a vibratory connection, which now seems to her like this <em>thing</em> could see her exposed self.</p> <h3 id="jean-luc-hides-like-a-hero"><a href="#jean-luc-hides-like-a-hero" class="header-anchor">#</a> Jean-Luc hides like a hero</h3> <p>Jean-Luc feels that he has been spotted. So he just โฆ disappears. Careful not to touch the edges of anything, he can hardly even see himself. He draws his daggers and holds his action should it become aggressive.</p> <p><code>Line of sight checks.</code></p> <p><code>CON save at the end of his turn. DC 16? he gets an 8.</code> His fingers begin to go numb from the cold and he already feels the first signs of frostbite occurring.</p> <p>Drav stays in the doorway, refusing to go into the room. She puts on a lovely <a href="/marshbout/items/dravs_scarf.html">scarf</a></p> <p>her mother knitted her, covered in leaves and gemstones.</p> <p>Startrella: Drav, I didn't know you did โฆ light painting?</p> <p>Drav: Oh, my mother made this for me. Isn't she so skilled and talented?</p> <p>Startrella: Yeah, that's incredible. We don't really have textiles here, so it's extra incredible. (They all suddenly realize that the Starchildren have been naked this whole time; the absence of clear genitalia making the condition less astonishing. Though they had observed small clusters of the arboreto-rice-grain-looking things around that area, the eggs -- or maybe just a skin condition -- had also appeared in other areas of their body, so they never seemed to denote a preferred sexual organ location. )</p> <p>Startrella: Did she give it to you for an occasion? Was it cold where you lived?</p> <p>Drav: No, just in case. On my 20th birthday I was planning on exploring a little further into the world, and she though it could be helpful.</p> <p>Flick stares arrows at the two for the inopportune moment they choose to discuss family heirlooms.</p> <p>Startrella: She had incredible foresight, it seems.</p> <p>Drav: Yes, my parents always have.</p> <p>Startrella: Nice of them to let you know you could go out with their blessing, and would be welcomed back warmly.</p> <p>Drav: Yes. (Failing to keep an eye out for the monster, of whose presence she is almost blissfully unaware.)</p> <p>She's having a lovely chat with startrella and looking around at this โฆ place.</p> <p>Drav took her action to brace herself against the cold. <code>CON save</code>. She feels her fingees a-tinglin' with warmth.</p> <h3 id="pjorg-s-pratfall"><a href="#pjorg-s-pratfall" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pjorg's pratfall</h3> <p>Pjorg knows there's a giant thing in the ice (TM). he moves his way in as stealthily as possible and gets lost in the complexities of the room. He runs into a shelf , and knocks off some book which snap and shatter as they hit the ground, and others look dessicated. He readies himself, shouting out <em>&quot;Small cold one, i see that you are small, and also cold. perhaps we can be friends?&quot;</em> <code>persuasion, 4</code>. Pjorg has just told it somehow both that it is small and that its mom โฆ eats shit? unacceptable.</p> <p>As though in response, the entire room shakes and stabby little crystal hail clatters down on them. He does feel like it understood him, even though he was speaking in Common. Pjorg awaits a reply (or, as the goliaths call it, a rebuttle, to his polite request for friendship).</p> <p>The shelves begin to shift and crack and cunch together. an abyssal opening appears between some of the shelves, and as they break into shards it looks like nothing so much as a giant maw. <em>A terrifying wall of frozen air spews out from the mouth</em>; even pjorg, who's confronted with the giganticism? of another creature. And Algiophobia or cryophobia.</p> <p>Jaap creates a body double with Invoke Duplicity, a perfect illusion of himself. Jaap number two. Jaap plucks him from wherever and pops him into the room. Jaap needs to see things but he can cast spells from the doppleganger.</p> <p>The actual jaap runs for cover, hiding his body behind the wall and leaving his head stick out like a cartoon. He's careful to not touch the wall. he then invokes the fiery โฆ tricksterism โฆ of Gaarl as from above it a pinprick opening that rapidly widens into a column of fire as thick as a tree (A thick โฆ tree) and starts to buzz like a field of bees. (perhaps his god has sent down the radiant damage instead of fire just because he's chaotic and unpredictable to his own followers.)</p> <p>for a moment jaap thinks he sees a kind of shrinking away from the fire at first.</p> <p>and he's like gaarl don't do me dirty like that, and garl gives him a little mustard on that pitch.</p> <p>Jean-Luc recognizes a moment when he sees one invisibly from within a creaking labyrinth of alien concrete.</p> <p>he gets so much damage. from assassinate and sneak attack. <code>82. nope 74</code> damage. 19 + 52 = 71. none of us know math.</p> <p>from out of nowhere jean-luc leaps on this things head and stab two daggers into its skull.</p> <p>jean-luc mugs to camera and says &quot;you'll have to BEAR with me&quot;</p> <p>pjorg knows that he's responsible for how well this is going and that he enabled this.</p> <p>jean-luc feels his daggers crack ice and pierce through goo as thick as hardened wax but somehow still viscous.</p> <p>startrella's arm-bow trick. to create her bow and arrow.</p> <p>&quot;I think we're going to clean this mess up pretty well, but i'm not looking forward to reading any of these books. maybe we can go somewhere else.&quot;</p> <p>goo-covered cover. startrella can't think straight in this place.</p> <p>with her &quot;archer's eye&quot; she can add damage.</p> <p>Flick wants to use the ability she has to throw her shield over herself.</p> <p>She wants someone to come barrelling at her.</p> <p>Flick, a little too far for her usual antics, trots in as a confident pace, strides past Jaap who she was sure is still outside and behin her,</p> <p>he channels the cold to cast zephyr's strike, condensing the anti-entropy that's making everything so cold to fire at the cold monster.</p> <p>so she basically has a very powerful refrigerator(well, if the inside is the outside) (which i guess is just an AC system) that makes force arrows .</p> <p>2:14</p> <p>Flick shoots it</p> <p>Jean-luc really worried they killed a librarian. but startrella shot it, so that's ok.</p> <p>jean-like gets sprayed by book goop and dust as flick misses on lsat arrow.</p> <p>flick: &quot;missing on the last hole, the story of my life&quot;</p> <p>jaap attacks/not-attacks</p> <ul><li>claw attack the mirror image , but go right through it. the librarian was upset he disturbed the quiet of this place.
