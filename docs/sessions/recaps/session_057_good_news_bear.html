(He has eaten &quot;Elephant Badger&quot; with mushrooms, a dish from his childhood. Elephant badgers are not taxonomically related to badgers. All the animals are given a large animal and a small animal name (which you'd think would have psychologically prepared him for this dual condition he finds himself in) depending on how you feel about them. So you say them both when you're cooking them, but if you feel bigger than them when you're &quot;out with them&quot; you call them an e.g. badger , but if you're sitting down or taking a nap then you would refer to them as an elephant badger?</p> <p>[In-laws talk]</p> <p>No real language scholars amongst the goliaths. &quot;They would dispute the existence of scholars at all, among every discipline everywhere.&quot; They like to dispute.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: Whatever's going on is going on in that house. I shall sprint towardseth the house!</p> <p>The rich spider venom of the Poras Spiders is too buttery for Pjorg's taste.</p> <p>Flick's back is against the tower door. She uses her bonus action to cast Zephyr's Strike. She dismisses Etherealness because Pelageena can apparently see her anyway. She makes her first weapon attack with Advantage.</p> <blockquote><p>Treating it like P. has not acted in the combat round yet. 21 Piercing on force arrow 25 piercing. She does not fail any concentration checks.</p></blockquote> <p>Even though Flick shoots the sorceress with two arrows, they don't throw Pelagena off her routine. The runes that cover all four walls, and the floor and ceiling; they glow brightly each time she's hit, and Flick can see blood dribbling down from the runes.</p> <blockquote><p>Flick's speed is 75.</p></blockquote> <p>She is so mad that doing &quot;so much damage&quot; didn't throw the sorceress off her game, and wishes she could make a shove attack. Instead, she … runs away.</p> <p>The staircase is a spiral stone staircase. She runs down it about 15 feet to obscure herself.</p> <blockquote><p>She doesn't have to concentrate on favored foe.</p></blockquote> <p>Flick runs for the stairs, as she dashes past them hears a cacophany of screaming whispers which sound like they're coming from -- she turns to look -- a wall of black void that''s swelling behind her, and she hears slurping mouth sounds. She feels ghostly tentacles chasing at her feet, and the darkness engulfs her as she runs out of breath. She's utterly blind, but begins to feel a sharp chill and the passage of slimy tentacles.</p> <p>Even blinded, she can tell when the tendrils come up against her, and can skip out of the way, but it is somewhat exhausting. When the droplets fall onto her skin, it feels like milky fizzlecyst acid.</p> <blockquote><p>Pelageena summons a shadow spirit.</p></blockquote> <p>JL is lassoed by dark cloudy whisps, and pull his own flesh out of him in slices, and his skin knits back together in greyish gooey webbing. As this happens, he imagines that Vengeance climbs through the window and plays his bagpipes in an effort to prove he's a triple threat, and the discordant notes of his bagpipes distract the ritual caster.</p> <p>Vengeance thinks they're going for a fast-pased witty action play, so chooses the Ten Axe character, giving him screwball dialog even though there' snone for him that he saw in the playbook. He pulls out his bagpipes. &quot;If this doesn't impress you and prove that I'm a triple threat, I don't know what will.&quot; and he begins playing the overture to Ten-Axe kills the witch.</p> <p>As V tries to hop in, he realizes he's coming up against a force field, but he can still hear what's going on inside. And he can see a human shadow creature hulked up next to a hemisphere of darkness in the rear corner.</p> <p>V performs the bagpipes, and assumes this is a window that can be broken by a high-frequency noise like a champagne glass.</p> <blockquote><p>I roll concentration against his performance.</p></blockquote> <p>For a second she attends to what he's doing, and he detects faint ripples appearing in the force window, but she continues gavorting and gallavanting around the room, but gesticulating precisely and in a practiced manner, but also wildly. IT looks like she has a great tech department behind her; as she points to the glyphs, in turn, each one of them lights up and then fade back into reddish embers as she plicks out the next one.</p> <p>Vengeance is really getting into the role now, and shouts, &quot;Out, foul witch!&quot;</p> <blockquote><p>Intimidation with disadvantage.</p></blockquote> <p>She hears him, and V can see that she raises her head and laughs. It seems like the sound engineer has turned up the volume inside to attempt to drown Vengeane out. Vengeance thinks about sundering the window, but nothing at the monastery acquainted him with this sort of magic, which makes him think it's immune to a lot. It probably doesn't extend the length of the wall, so the stone next to it probably doesn't have a force wall behind it.</p> <p>He then remembers a window in the floor below that is quite narrow but could accommodate his slim form.</p> <blockquote><p>Dex KL. 1.</p></blockquote> <p>As he's trying to get in, he loses his grip and slides down another 10 feet before he can catch himself. On the first floor, finally, he cranks his mediumshanks into the window aperture. he's in a room that's covered in old slate broken into pieces. To his right there's a door frame, and it's been blown off it's hinges. It lies shattered in pieces off to the right, in that room. Coming from that room he sees an eerie greenish pulsing glow. He moves towards that. The broken slate has spilled out into this room, primarily because the floor is a sloping dirt floor. at the far end of the room is a slick, algae-covered pool of water which ripples slightly as he steps into the room. another pool has formed in a depression in the middle of the room. between them lies a kind of stony path, and at the far wall is the remnants of a wooden catwalk.</p> <p>&quot;This is kind of a weird green room, but this is definitely my style. It will give me some place to relax before my audition.&quot; He sees something to the left that could be waterbottles and snacks. he knows that's always a test. for the most part they are ceramic jars with lids of varying sizes. a few are cracked and covered in cobwebs, but a few look dust-free and like they're been handled recently. He sits and waits.</p> <p>Pjorg is still outside, and runs as far as he can.</p> <blockquote><p>DC 15 wisdom save. 4 points of necrotic damage.</p></blockquote> <p>He sees a blackish-grey cloud hoveer above his head like an anti-halo and settle into his mind. He's beset by the frightening vision of furniture that is larger than he is and particularly large doorways. Looking at the manor house, seeing the arched double-doorway, which gets larger and larger and eventually dwarfs the house, such that it's a yawning portal larger than what it leads into. and he also remembers as a child he was read the story of Matilda, a little goliath child who puts shims of wood under their grandparenth's goliath cane and table and confuses them until they get dimentia which is caused by the discrepancy between how tall they are and how tall they think they are , but he remembers that it 's a children's story and that he'd gotten over the fear by telling himself he'd never be small ever again and do nothing but grow taller until he got old, and by force of Mind Strength, shrinks down the apparent image of the door.</p> <p>Jaap considers trying to get to someone and bring them with him, but, that option notwithstanding? he dimension door's up into the tower room. A huge globe of darkness around his the air is frosting, and milky-white tentacles that lick the air.</p> <p>When Drav first showed up at the estate in daylight, she couldn't see anything by darkfall an actual tornado had begun to form, centered on the hill.</p> <blockquote><p>Investigation 24.</p></blockquote> <p>She thinks it wasn't expanding; it may have been increasing in strength, but it wasn't moving, within the radius stopping at the stables.</p> <p>Drav: You've got ao pretty good setup here, but that tornado's looking pretty nasty, I'm not sure, even if you're able to hang out in there for a few hours, i'm not sure what the world is going to look like. we've been able to get ourselves out of pretty difficult situations.</p> <p>She puts a lot of dwarven pathos into the plea.</p> <p>T: I know that they estate is going to be destroyed; that's exactly what my sister wants. I can't go up against her and I can't leave until the spell keeping me here is nullified.</p> <p>Drav: Why can't you go up against her? Is there some way we can help?</p> <p>Tishara: I brought you here to help … I learned that you were my only chance to keep the estate up. I'm hoping you can do what I can't.</p> <p>Drav: Well even if you're not able to contest her directly, I'm sure you know there's a lot you know about what she's doing, and specific things that can help. Isn't there anything you can tell us?</p> <p>Tishara: My sister spent a lot of time learning about the different planes. It's magic I've intentionally avoided; as far as that goes I have very little help to offer. I do know that that black stone in the amphitheatre is the source of what's happening. Aside from removing or destroying that or killing or incapacitating my sister I don't know how this can be stopped. She has so many wards that she's put in place in that tower, and she can direct the forces of what's going on, and it's too much for me.</p> <p>Drav: That's already more than we knew before coming here, so I think you can still help us.</p> <p>Tishara: I'm not sure why i'm telling you this, but most of what i've done is to maintain 'believable inaction' [plausible deniability] where if she knows i've participated in stopping her plans then I'll be a target of her vengeance as long as i live. Usually this is where someone would say &quot;and now I have to kill you for telling you that.&quot; but I don't want to break the sanctity of my little mansion here. you're safe for now! and that's only a joke, too, haha.</p> <p>Drav: There's no reaon you have to help out in a visible way. We can say 'Oh, who, Tishara? Who's that? We came on this information in a completely unrelated manner'</p> <p>Tishara: I don't want to uh … criticize you … but even your friend Vengeance's acting chops are better than what I heard now. I'll tell you whatever I know that can help you, but I really don't want to leave this spot. I don't want the estate destroyed -- that's my inheritance, and it's why she seeks to destroy it! But I would rather have my life than property, as it comes down to it.</p> <p>Drav can put it together that part of this is a quarrel between two rich sisters, but not the part where one sister would turn to a cataclysmic outcome out of spite.</p> <p>Drav: You don't have to leave this hut, as long as you tell me anything of use.</p> <p>Drav does not say that she will collapse the cave on Tishara.</p> <p>T: I know that her interest here goes beyond even my sole inheritance. She's also taken this as an opportunity to experiment with means of siphoning power from the other planes. Once, when we were still on speaking terms, she'd had a little too much Tepplin whiskey that night, and revealed to me what I thought were drunking ramblings of a planar magic pedant, but what she had said was that the Ethereal Plane acts as a switchboard for magic, and one grows to great, it evens that out by delivering that to another plane. which in her mind is why the material plane has magic at all, so she believed that if she could collapse the two into one, she would have access to all the magic of all the planes which was superabundant.</p> <p>As to what the black rock is, I know that less than a year ago there was a large explosion south of here, and a few nights after she took three or four carts south of here, and coming back one of the carts was loaded such that it was low on its axels. She must have brought it back then, but I don't know where it came from.</p> <p>As far as getting to her through the mansion, the house is full of glyphs especially coming up the staircase. She has so many rooms in that place now that our mother has been absent for years, I hesitate to guess what crude experiments are going on.</p> <p>Drav: Any of that could be the key to defeating her. And one more thing …</p> <p>Tishara's timeline matches up with what Nuphar the newly Naiad had said about an explosion or meteorite that landed and created the Planhage lake. The only thing that matches the description of the rock is when she looked at the Gormflaith brooch, inside the turqoise and iridium.</p> <p>Drav: I think we'll work something out. Thanks?</p> <p>And she chuggs out and up to Longcoat, and they make it about 1/3 of the way to the house, coming just under the swirling gouts of earth and cloud.</p> <p>Jean-Luc, in pretty bad shape, unstraps the cast iron helmet from his … belt … ? and polymorphs into a werebear.</p> <p>&quot;As a bear&quot; I want to charge forward , growl, and blow the doors off this manor house. This iron-banded wooden door isn't knocked fully out of the frame, but they're split at the center, and then swing all the way around until they split against the inside stone walls.</p> <p>Jean-Luc-Bear smashes into the foyer, looking at a large rug on the wall, a bear head mounted on a shield backing staring at him from the opposing side, and quite a few doors leading off .</p> <blockquote><p>Smell-based perception check.</p></blockquote> <p>He can't differentiate floors all that well -- most of the organic smelling matter is coming from the left, under or in the tower.</p> <blockquote><p>WIS KH. d 15</p></blockquote> <p>As he walks further into the foyer, he's not sure if it's the new form or the raw power, but it feels like he's seeing a warp in spacetime, and he can see a little silverfish crawling across the ground moving very slowly, and a grey glyph shining out from each of the mounted bear's head's eyes. He surmises (smells) that he's avoided the effects of a 'slow' spell.</p> <p>If I have an attack, I'd like to attack the silverfish. He attacks with both claws; it's so small he hits it with his literal south paw -- it's obliterated so thoroughly it looks like he has silver nailpolish on a claw.</p> <p>In the darkness, Flick assumes that it's something that she tripped, like some ladder she set off, but the longer she sits the colder she begins to feel, as her toes and fingers start to get frostbite and her eyelashes frost over. She feels her way back up the stairs and out into the light, sees Jaap has made it into the room, and a shadowy human figure , and the brain ooze that's made it into the room. She reaches out through the quickly merging planes and gives Pelageena &quot;both barrels&quot; . She pulls the string back, as the arrow sizzles and sparks, (so uses Favored Foe this time) -- this knocks her forard, away from Flick, but (concentration check) she's able to incorporate the hit into her bows and straightening. She moves with her back against the wall and window, and joins Jaap.</p> <p>Jaap, (since Michael's missed half a turn from computer business) sees Flick burst out of the darkness, shattering frost in the air and herself covered in small icicles, her hair crispy with crystals. And a pile of yellowish-orange goop, with the distinctive chunks of brain tissue in it. Jaap casts Spirit Guardians, exempting Pjorg (is that Pjorg out there?) and Flick.</p> <p>What do the Spirit Guardians look like? Fey creatures, pixies sort of. Trickster Fox, Badger, and Elephant Badger</p> <p>[ more about in-laws and trickiness]</p> <p>Pjorg avoids some necrotic tendrils lashing out at him; he stands stoically still and the tendrils assume he's going to move, but he doesn't -- they are in a stand-off. they lose interest after a moment.</p> <p>As Vengeance waits in the room, he sees rising to the surface of the lake, half a dozen large cocoons that look almost like slugs made of paper mache or dried algae preserved in an oily film; the pond is acting like a tidal body, depositing them and retreating.</p> <p>Vengeance, to himself, &quot;We used to have these at every on of my birthday parties. I mean, not mine, because they never threw me a party, but all of my friends had one at their birthday parties, and they loved them, they were always filled with slugs and maggots and grubs&quot; and he takes his quarterstaff and tries to hit one of them like a pinata.</p> <p>He smashes into the cocoon that looks the plumpest, and filled with delicious treats. [and it looks like …] as he gets close he sees that there is a shape throbbing inside through the translucent skin of the cocoon.</p> <p>&quot;I hope it's a floating eel, they are always the tastiest.&quot;</p> <blockquote><p>Inv. nat 1.</p></blockquote> <p>It's definitely going to be a floating eel.</p> <p>As he smashes the cocoon, the seams between the bits of vegetal wrapping begin to separate, and the delicious thick body of an eel, covered in his favorite natural eel sauce excretion, squeezes out through the integument of the cocoon.</p> <p>Abandoning his quarterstaff, he drops to his knees and begins to claw ineffectually at the tough casing of this thing. &quot;It's always harder when you're not blindfolded&quot; he murmurs to himself.</p> <p>He sees that, of the ones he's come close to, they are beginning to extrude bluish-green tentacles humping directly towards him. He reaches out and tries to open the cocoon and see what's inside. Immediately he realizes it's not one of his favored eels; it's covered in a sort of fur or hide. It appears to be a huge cat, an adult cat, but the size of a pig. It looks to have been extracted too soon, as there is no life in its eyes.</p> <p>&quot;Well the cat's out of the bag. i guess i'll try to wake it up.&quot; and begins gently to stroke its goopy ears.</p> <blockquote><p>Medicine check</p></blockquote> <p>As he does this, Vengeance accidentally transfers qi, and the creature opens its eyes and begins to purr and halfheartedly lick the goo off itself.</p> <p>I'm sorry Roxfallanah, I believe I've found my new partner. It was just never meant to be, professionally speaking. What do you think … would you like to join me in my audition?</p> <blockquote><p>Animal handling KL.</p></blockquote> <p>Its ears are so full of the glue that it doesn't appear to have heard it. Vengeance thinks it might be a good idea to clean the placental film off the creature. Let's get those ears cleaned! and he puts his thrush shoes on the ends of his self-killer and use as a q-tip .</p> <p>Pjorg makes his way into the front door that's been &quot;born&quot; open. Pjorg says this and chortles to himself.</p> <p>Was Pjorg accused of being a pedant in Goliath society for all his puns? &quot;They don't have a word for that, but yes: they made one up. It's Pjorgful, like prideful.&quot; Is it important to them to be anti-intellectual? &quot;You would think, but that's kind of a prejudice, in the same way that people are prejudiced against goblins.&quot; The mysterious disappearance of goblins from the continent remains largely unexplored, although the two-dozen or so here may offer some clues.</p> <p>[1:38]</p> <p>Pjorg is now next to the castle, and experiences one more unfortunately event.</p> <blockquote><p>Fails a DC 14 con save.</p></blockquote> <p>The tendrils confused by his immobility make a last ditch attempt, and stab him in his remaining healthy flesh.</p> <p>Jaap feels all the goblins-without-head-tops as latent undead.</p> <p>Drav feels as though her mind is being invaded by prohibited arcane magic, but she buries her face in the warm earthy smell of Longcoat's mane, and the grounding that gives her the rocks and land ward off the whispers. (Drav's ultimate fear is that her birth parents and her adoptive parents, don't love her.)</p> <p>Some inverse-genii spell that can eradicate love, and she turned paged fast as she could despite how intersted in learning she was; one of few spells she didn't want to learn in depth; and she turned the pages as fast as she could.</p> <p>Longcoat nickers comfortingly.</p> <p>Around Pelageena erupts a shield … of fire. after jaap's trickster guardians poke and prod at her with their talons of wisdom or something. And he uses Blessed Strike to do an extra 1d8. They chase her off and bite her, and her speed is halved. And she does 2 concentration checks.</p> <p>Pelageena uses that half of her movement to extricate herself from the Spirit Guardians radius. Jaap: &quot;I'll get her back in.&quot; (mockingly) &quot;Where are you going? I'm just a little gnome.&quot;</p> <p>The shadow creature slashes into Flick with ice-cold talons and screams loudly and theatrically.</p> <blockquote><p>CON SAVE DC 15 Jaap and Flic.</p></blockquote> <p>Jaap is deaf for one minute, and Flick.</p> <blockquote><p>Flick's speed is reduced by 20 feet until the start of her next turn.</p></blockquote> <p>Jaap is getting dangerously close to this Brain Ooze, but it still manages to course its way slowly towards him.</p> <blockquote><p>Ooze fails the wisdom saving throw on spirit guardians. and takes 12 damage.</p></blockquote> <p>Ooze snakes a pseudopod up on either side of Jaap, leaving trailing bits of dark orange goo on his plate armor.</p> <p>Jean-Luc-Bear sniffs the air again. There are nauseating and corpselike smells coming from the tower area. Lower down he smells sludge, and newborn animals (placental blood or goo). Elsewhere in the building is a human scent coming from the far-back right. He knows there are servants quarters. He can also detect that there are drafts coming in from wood-panelled areas next to the room (Secret passages?).</p> <p>JLB blows the door open with his bear strength, and sees in the corner a staircase, and above him in the corner closest to him is water collecting on the ceiling and dripping down. There are drips throughout the wall next to him and into the middle of the room; they smell like rotten eggs and vinegar. He can see symbols carved into the underside of the stone stairs.</p> <blockquote><p>DEX save KH DC 15 CON. fail. JLB uses point of inspiration.</p> <p>12 force damage Slashing at the glyph with his claws severs some invisible container, and a concussive wave smashes him across the room, his claws digging into the soft wood floor.</p></blockquote> <p>He lets out a loud roar, which Vengeance hears in his swampy egg room. A new sort of scream-based audition must be taking place. A bit of Jean-Luc's smooth natural voice comes through, and the roars are oddly melodic.</p> <p>Vengeance, as he stands next to the cocoons, the one he pulled the cat out of has collapsed; the other, with a body inside, inches its tendrils forwards.</p> <blockquote><p>19 to hit for 5 slashing damage Breathing life into the wet and sticky cat's body, he's taken unawares when sharp serrated thorns on the tendril slash into his leg, opening up lacerations which immediately puff up in angry red welts.</p></blockquote> <p>Vengeance is confirmed in his belief that these are the pinatas used at the monastery, because this sort of thing would happen once in a while. You'd either get a reward or a punishment. He also recalls one weird instance where, as a tendril snuck out of a cocoon, he noticed a triangle of bright golden light appear next to him and slice off the tendril. He looked around, and it seemed as though Yngvildr, giving him a wink, had somehow conjured this into being, but he was secretly feuding with Yngvildr so consciously disregarded this act of concern. He didn't give it any more thought at the time, but now, thinking back on it, his feud in part had been because Yngvildr always proved far more incompetent than he, a 'virtue' which he could never forgive, and that alone would have precluded her from such an act of kindness. Maybe this shining golden light … emerged from him? In either case, he would never cease to hate Yngvildr; a hate, however, which would itself never eclipse that he held for Schlonzel; and that hatred magnified by the similarity between the texture of the cocoons and Schlonzel's repulsive skin.</p> <blockquote><p>Flick moves without provoking opportunity attacks. First weapon attack of the round has advantage. and hits 23 force damage. [] She passes her con check, but is bloodied.</p></blockquote> <p>_The blood seeping from the glyphs on the wall begins to collect quicker, falling now in coursing rivulets down the joints of the stone wall.</p> <p>&quot;I'm finally getting through to you you awful, awful woman&quot; Flick shouts, though, being temporarily deafened, without being able to hear anything, picking her way over into Jaap's spirit umbrella. The badger 'clearly approves' of Flick, who fires another arrow at the woman as her inner fire burns brightly.</p> <blockquote><p>12 piercing (after halved) and passes a CON check.</p></blockquote> <p>[]</p> <p>Flick eyes the shadow, who, despite Flick's aeolian extrication, nearly caught her in its black feathery claws, and decides not to risk adjacency for the moment and drops into a defensive crouch. (Flick used to think the Ethereal Plane was a nice friendly place that helped her, but she's going to have to rethink that.)</p> <p>Vengeance, meanwhile, sees the cocoon has drawn the sliver of flesh from his thigh back into itself and appears to be macerating it in a leafy well glistening with a lime green liquid. He's cradling the cat's pumpkin-sized head on his lap as it purrs wetly. Having heard all the scream auditions, he picks up the ungainly feline and hoists it over his shoulder, &quot;I know you were just born, and your ears haven't been properly cleaned, but we just have to get to this audition, there's no time.&quot; As he rushes away, he can see the last cocoon, enlivened by consuming his flesh, slashing into him again with its sawtoothed tendrils. He makes his way to the third floor a black void, out of which emerges wafts of freezing air and freakish whispers like those he used to hear emanating from the monastery's lavatories. He's so swift that he bursts through the sphere while the shards of souls are swatted away by the loudly mewing cat. He puts down the cat and prepares to perform his audition.</p> <blockquote><p>Insight 17</p></blockquote> <p>Vengeance has never seen Tishara &quot;not in costume,&quot; but suspects that the woman in the tower now (actually Pelageena) is not Tishara but Tishara's body double, dressed in Tishara's costume with blood and gore makeup on (probably too intricate to put on someone during a scene change) so thinks that maybe the person he should be auditioning for isn't in the room, but this could be someone he has to beat in an audition, if they are already an understudy. He believes Tishara is watching from a secret hiding spot. He jumps in, and to the body double, says, &quot;Well, it looks like we're going to be scene partners. I'm sorry we don't have time to get to know each other. I think this is going to be great, just follow my lead.&quot;</p> <blockquote><p>Performance</p></blockquote> <p>She keeps her back to Vengeance and continues on. It's clearly a snub. &quot;Well, fine, I guess it's just going to be me and the cat.&quot;</p> <p>Pjorg is still outside the manor house. He rushes through the bear-door / doggy door. He sees that the door to his left is exploded open, and sees dust and hair swirling in gusts in that room. Spiral Stone staircase enclosed within a column of stone. To his left is the werebear that JL has become, having just suffered an impact-resist-slide.</p> <blockquote><p>STR save KH. nat 20.</p></blockquote> <p>There are runes carved into the staircase for PulseWave, and the bear claw marks through them activated the glyphs and it's now spent. Pjorg goes up the stairs.</p> <blockquote><p>Does Pjorg have an interest in learning glyphs? He thinks so, but not in the middle of a massive world-ending thing that has been quickly killing Pjorg. If he comes back here and the staircase still exists, he could probably pick this ward up. Pjorg is not the kind of a learner where he can learn really quickly. He may have to do a lot of adjunctive punching.</p></blockquote> <p>Drav continues towards the mansion.</p> <blockquote><p>DEX saving throw KH.</p></blockquote> <p>She sees huge black orbs thunder into the ground ahead of her, Longcoat unable to avoid the explosions of anti-magic spheres. Drav drags Longcoat the 40 feet (nat 20) using an insane reservoir of strength for wounded animals, she pulls herself and longcoat outside the radius of the sphere. And with a nat 19 she stabilizes Longcoat so she's unconsious but stable.</p> <p>&quot;Why wasn't Roxfallanah better?&quot; Vengeance thinks to himself suddenly.</p> <p>Drav pours a healing potion down her throat, and she rouses herself, bruised all over but ok. &quot;You deserve a rest, buddy&quot; and slaps her on the flanks to go back to the stables. Longcoat bolts southwest.</p> <blockquote><p>Gnomes are impulsive.</p></blockquote> <p>Jaap casts cure wounds on Flick at 3rd level.
