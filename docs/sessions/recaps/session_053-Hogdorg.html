Vengeance is just thinking about how hungry he is.</p> <p><code>[Flick 15 survival.]</code></p> <p>If the same amount was on the bite he took, it wouldn't kill him. &quot;He must have really let his guard down to be sold a poisoned hot dog.&quot; The scuffle marks around the area indicate three assailants, and the wheels of a trolley that lead back into an alleyway.</p> <p>Flick walks back into the ruelle<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> which opens up into a courtlet<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> that's being used for refuse; there are upturned barrels and crates. She does see a trolley.</p> <p>Jaap looks for logos or symbols on the trolley, which actually appears to have been painted recently in red and yellow stripes, indicating it may have been the hogdog trolley. He doesn't see any sign of a creature being dragged; it's just cobblestones and hard to pick up a trail. He surveys the walls of the court, and notices a face peeking out from some slatted blinds. Attempting to be inconspicuous, Jaap lets the rest of the group know that someone is watching them.</p> <p>Pjorg has to will himself to keep from squaring his shoulders and glaring directly at the indicated window. (He's also taught his muscles to ignore the dictates of his will, though.)</p> <p><code>[Group stealth check. Resigned guffaws. Drav's bad day.]</code></p> <p>Drav slaps the sides of the cart, &quot;Hey, look at this weird trolley, what's with that?!&quot; She's strong that the aluminum echoes within the enclosed area. The face in the window disappears.</p> <blockquote><p>Everybody make a perception check.</p></blockquote> <h3 id="the-chase"><a href="#the-chase" class="header-anchor">#</a> the chase</h3> <p>Jaap runs &quot;they're getting away!&quot; and begins to run after the creature. Flick takes off after Jaap.</p> <p>Flick runs after him, draws her bow, [used a bonus action to activate Planar Warrior] in order to shove at distance. The diminitude of the creature and his familiarity with his surroundings causes her first shot to go wide. The second shot is true, and he goes sprawling onto the ground.</p> <p>Flick in a monotone says &quot;Wait, no, stop.&quot; He loops back at Flick, his pointy features creating a brutalist silhouette out of which fiery red eyes glow, all crowned by a deep black top-knot.</p> <p>Flick: &quot;Only the guilty run.&quot;</p> <p>A man in a chef's outfit comes out balancing seven boxes of hogdogs and hogdog buns (&quot;sliced rolls&quot;); Pjorg takes both of his legs out at the ankles, and he goes ass over teakettle as the hogdogs firework from their boxes.</p> <blockquote><p>rún gearrthóir (roon gar hor) (rune cutter)</p> <p>Sleight of hand … 20</p></blockquote> <p>Pjorg grabs a hogdog right out of the air. He then Dashes to catch up to the course. He smashes into the goblin, crab-crawling backwards, and pins him to the ground with the weight of his armor.</p> <p>The goblin, claiming he's just running out for ingredients, has to get back to the rising rolls to stick the hogdogs on top with mustard glue. Pjorg suggests a split roll, and accuses the goblin of &quot;primitive&quot; culinary techniques. The goblin takes this as anti-goblin sentiment and asks if Pjorg is associating himself with &quot;the tall ones&quot; to which Pjorg replies &quot;I am a tall one.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Have you taken a look at yourself in the mirror lately?&quot; &quot;no. what is a mirror&quot; &quot;A reflective surface&quot; &quot;I don't look at reflections because they show things that aren't true.&quot; &quot;Your armor's quite shiny tho.&quot; &quot;Am i looking at it?&quot; &quot;Uhh wouldn't you have to to polish it?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Maybe seek out a window or lake or something…&quot; &quot;Friends, he's a hogdog guy. He's getting hogdog things. Shall I keep him pinned to the ground.&quot; Flick: Yes, please.</p> <h3 id="the-interrogation"><a href="#the-interrogation" class="header-anchor">#</a> the interrogation</h3> <p>Get off! Look, I'll pay you for your idea about the split rolls, ok, is that why you're holding me here? asks the panicked goblin. No, I'm merely reclining in leisure, says Pjorg. What about you? (looking at Jaap) first can you tell this guy he's not tall and then ask him to get off of me. Sure, but point blank, yo, why are you trying to poison our friend with a hogdog? Jaap asks. (Looking at Pjorg) Poison? He doesn't look poisoned to me, he looked like he thought the hogdog was delicious. It was! says Pjorg. A different friend. Someone you previously sold a hogdog to, clarified Jaap. Hey man, we have a no-return policy. Oh, but this is not about returns. This is about somebody who got kidnapped after eating a bad hogdog. Probably … we found some poison on the hogdogs. Look, Glittering, my hogdogs are so good I can see them being used as bait, but I don't know what you're talking about.</p> <blockquote><p>Insight checks.</p></blockquote> <p>They can immediately tell that he's lying.</p> <p>Jaap: Don't tell me any lies now. WHy were you trying to poison and kidnap our friend.</p> <p>Hey! Look, I didn't kidnap anybody. When somebody says they are going to give you fifty gold to put their own mustard on a hotdog you take the coin.</p> <p>I can understand that, Jaap replies. Can you describe this person to us?</p> <p>Yeah, yeah, sure, they were humans, wearing these fancy masks, they came all the way into the house, there were beads on them, maybe different colors. Their clothes were quite nice, they didn't look like aristocrats but they were definitely well-off.</p> <p>Jaap: Is there anything else that you can tell us? Were they speaking with an accent or other thing out of the ordinary.</p> <p>Goblin: Yeah, they cast a spell where I couldn't hear anything at all, so I just kind of got out of there. They'd given me the gold earlier, you see, when I'd put the mustard on the hogdog. It seemed like they had a bit of money to throw around. They gave me the money in the house and told me to take the trolley into the street when I got cued and offer the hogdog.</p> <p>Flick: What did the mark look like?</p> <p>Goblin: Oh, he was handsome. Beatiful flowing golden locks, well-tanned face, well-built, lithe</p> <p>Flick: After you gave the hotdog to him what happened?</p> <p>Goblin: I think he just … went willingly with them?</p> <blockquote><p>Insight.</p></blockquote> <p>Flick and Jaap can tell he's hiding something.</p> <p>Flick leans down, I'm going to give you a chance to answer that question again, and I want the truth this time.</p> <blockquote><p>Intimidation</p></blockquote> <p>Goblin: Ok, look, I wasn't lying, his body was willing but the spirit was weak, if you get my drift.</p> <p>Flick: I do not.</p> <p>Goblin: He basically just passed out after starting to defend himself. The silence was right after I gave him the hotdog. It looked like he opened his mouth to try to shout, but nothing came out.</p> <p>Flick: Where did they take him?</p> <p>Goblin: Off that way, east.</p> <p>Flick: I'm Not going to leave him at the mercy of these Hat Basket motherfuckers.</p> <p>Jaap: How many people were there?</p> <p>Goblin: I saw three of them, who ended up dragging him off.</p> <p>Pjorg yawns and lazily gets off him and helps him up. One day you'll be as big as I am I hope for your sake, and claps him too hard on the back.</p> <p>Gimpel: Like, I'll have the same armor as you that makes you look a lot wider?</p> <p>Pjorg: Of course, small one.</p> <p>Gimpel: I'm a chef and a vendor, there's really no need.</p> <p>Pjorg: I see it distinctly in your future.</p> <p>Gimpel: Are you a divinator?</p> <p>Pjorg: I don't know the meaning of the word. I just know that someone who sells such good hogdogs has a real place in the world.</p> <p>Gimpel: I know that Maryatt's been having some intense stomach pains, and I was hoping for a divinator or something to determine who'd placed a curse on her or draw the evil out.</p> <p>Pjorg: You say your an artist who draws evil?</p> <p>Gimpel: I suppose I was speaking figuratively, meaning, to cure her.</p> <p>Pjorg: I understand. Enjoy your life of adventure, hogdogman.</p> <blockquote><p>Survival check for tracking clues<br></p> <p>Drav Insight/religion : 10</p></blockquote> <h3 id="tracking-the-kidnappers"><a href="#tracking-the-kidnappers" class="header-anchor">#</a> tracking the kidnappers</h3> <p>Flick is convinced that Hogdogman Gimpel is largely innocent, starts looking for signs in the road, looking for a sign of a person being carried or dragged by three others.</p> <p>Walking down this street where Gimpel had pointed, there are cobblestones with guttering between them; the mud in the gutters turns to dust on the stones, and there is a great deal of fish refuse from the . They can see somehow has been dragged down the street and hoisted up on a cart, and the cart tracks can be followed up north, and then out northwest as though to travel out of the city on a western route.</p> <p>Flick: They're absconding with him!</p> <p>Drav goes to touch the stones and hears very faint whispers and can't tell where they are coming from.</p> <blockquote><p>Investigation 22.</p></blockquote> <p>It sounds to Drav like the stones are starting to communicate with her.</p> <p>Rocks: &quot;This way, this way, dragged this way.&quot; They can't communicate all that much, except directionally. They direct them &quot;out to the country&quot; at the point the trail goes that way. It doesn't seem to be sandstone, but rather common river stones.</p> <p>Drav: Hey, the stones told me he went this way.</p> <p>Flick: The stones … told … you ?</p> <p>Drav: Well, we'll see what happens, I guess.</p> <p>On this trajectory, it's impossible to tell if there's a specific location they're heading for.</p> <p>Flick takes off at a trot in the direction</p> <p>JL: I worry we might not be the crusaders of truth and justice we think we are.</p> <h3 id="surf-and-turf"><a href="#surf-and-turf" class="header-anchor">#</a> Surf and turf</h3> <p>Vengeance is still fishing off the pier.</p> <blockquote><p>Perception / Religion</p></blockquote> <p>He feels a strange vibration around his neck, and suddenly he realizes the necklace he made out of JL's toenails is beginning to jitter and rotate around his neck, and stretching out and trying to pull in a direction.</p> <p>Vengeance goes where it takes him and doesn't struggle. &quot;It's finally happening. This is what I've been waiting for&quot; he thinks to himself. &quot;I don't remember why I made this necklace, but it's clearly being realized.&quot; It must be a taco detector, taking him to more good fish. He does pass … close … to the trendy fish taco wagon.</p> <p>&quot;My sister Leema has another trendy taco wagon up there, make sure you visit it.&quot;</p> <p>There was also a species of fish that Schlonzel had told Vengeance had a foot fetish .. in the sense that they ate toenails. But now he thinks Schlonzel must have been putting him on, and that's why he never caught fish, and he always tried toenail bait.</p> <p>Soon he encounters the rest of the adventuring party (sans JL)</p> <p>V: So I guess one of you has the tacos that I'm looking for? It's tilapia or nothing. he asks the group. It has to have the right sauce, spices, and herbs. It has to be zesty.</p> <p>The necklace Vengeance is wearing is almost horizontal to the ground, pointing in the direction they think JL is.</p> <p>Come on, everyone, this way to delicious fish!</p> <p>Flick isn't following him based on that, but he knows vengeance to be a &quot;Vortex of strange fortuitous happenings&quot;</p> <p>He runs up the street, but kind of has to keep tacking a bit. Vengeance starts salivating so much…</p> <blockquote><p>DEX save</p></blockquote> <p>As the saliva mixes with the fascia of the fish skin, he surfs on the street, but ends up smashing into a building. &quot;Surf and Turf!&quot;</p> <p>Angela suggests De-Motivation points that let you replace enemy rolls. #ideas</p> <h3 id="jean-luc"><a href="#jean-luc" class="header-anchor">#</a> Jean-Luc</h3> <p>JL is sitting tied up in a stables, speaking to a woman wearing (horse) riding clothing who appears to be breathing a bit hard, and has just let him know that &quot;without the ledge of Pathytus your companions will have to do their own accounting: Of your body parts!!&quot;</p> <p>JL thinks that Vengeance would enjoy that. With her watching it might be too difficult to get out of the ropes. &quot;This isn't going to work out the way you want it to.&quot;</p> <p>You're making some assumptions about the way I want it to work out, Tishara replies.</p> <p>My companions and I have an unfortunate habit of 'asking questions later'. on the other hand, if you let me go, perhaps I can get them to get you to give you the ledger peacefully.</p> <p>Tishara: At this point you're assuming that I don't want your companions too.</p> <p>JL: If you wanted all of us here, you probably wouldn't just have kidnapped me. Now you're just a sitting target. You guys need to get better at this -- as a thieves' guild you're a little lacking. (JL is annoyed at the lack of professional courtesy he's being shown)</p> <blockquote><p>Good persuasion roll.</p></blockquote> <p>Look, mother's choice of my profession may not have been perfect, but in order to get what I'm owed I do have to pursue it in my own way, so I'm sorry I'm not doing this perfectly! This estate has more than enough resources to entrap someone who comes to your aid.</p> <p>JL: Well if you have these resources there's way better ways to get the Ledger, for Glob's sake.</p> <p>Tishara: How dare you take the name of Glob in vain, here! And the estate's resources are not mine to use outside the pale.</p> <p>JL: That is a very nice saddle on the wall there --</p> <p>TV: Don't look at that saddle. (She hustles over quickly and arranges a cloth over it)</p> <p>JL: That's a very nice cloth; your riding clothes scream &quot;professional horse show&quot; which isn't something the peasants participate in, so this Ledger, whatever it is, I can only assume it's important to your quite well connected family. But this is a poor way to go about getting it.</p> <p>TV: I've had to make certain accommodations; I have to keep the resources on the estate.</p> <p>JL: Are you saying you're not liquid. Because I know a lot about commercial real estate: i could find some good investment properties for you.</p> <p>TV: well when I come into my own , it will all be mine to use as I desire, but for now I don't have claim over the domain; i have to make use of it in situ</p> <p>JL: Oh this is one of those &quot;mother won't let me control the purse strings&quot; kinds of things? That's a bit disappointing.</p> <p>TV: Yes, it's boring to me too!</p> <p>JL: I was at least hoping you'd be a revolutionary; you're just a spoiled trust fund brat.</p> <p>TV: Revolutionary? What are you revolutioning against?</p> <p>JL: You know, stand up for the people, overthrow the patriarchy. What is so important about this ledger anyway.</p> <p>TV: Sure, in certain respects it's a ledger of mih q'guphyn, that ancient sorcerer whose ledgers were sought after for decades and ended up being entirely useless, but I do know that, at least according to my mother, and me getting it for her will prove that I'm a worthy daughter and will inherit the property when it comes time.</p> <p>JL: If i may be so bold, who else is in line for this inheritance.</p> <blockquote><p>PERSuasion.</p></blockquote> <p>JL has played out this line --</p> <p>TV: Well, that's family business.

He reaches into his bag and pulls out a dead angler fish. This is what I was looking for all along.</p> <p>Leema's Fancy Fish High Fanciness Food Truck is glaring at him, but the necklace is no longer pointing &quot;at&quot; it, but it did stop here. He peers into a building with the shingle The Bezzler's Edge (someone into shady finances or someone who sharpens knives?) but when he looks inside given the number of leather bound tomes and sharp edges it might be both; maybe someone who defends their shady activities with martial skill. He is fairly close to the outskirts of the city.</p> <p>V calls his companions over. Let's look around, that fish taco has to be around here somewhere.</p> <blockquote><p>Investigation 12.</p></blockquote> <p>After V's hunger is satisfied, he can reflect and think it probably wasn't just pointing to a fish truck. It's really his hunger that's been taken him on a journey. (he didn't catch anything at the pier, but even small children were pulling out lengthy specimens).</p> <p>&quot;I suppose my mind was just clouded by hunger, but now I know we are in the vicinity of Jean-Luc, with whom I share a special bond, and best-friendliness, as I'm sure he would agree&quot;</p> <p>Jean-Luc's ears start burning red and he shakes his head, miles away.</p> <h3 id="creatures-ash-the-crow"><a href="#creatures-ash-the-crow" class="header-anchor">#</a> <a href="/marshbout/creatures/ash_the_crow.html">../../creatures/ash_the_crow</a></h3> <p>Flick looks at the direction Vengeance was pointing in when the necklace failed. She takes stock of the wildlife around; farmland circumscribes the town boundaries, which gives way to the hills out west, and swamp up north. She emits a series of coos, caws, rattles, and clicks.</p> <p>Flick casts Speak with Animals and invites the crows over to him.</p> <p>Flick knows they are &quot;humble but also proud&quot; and asks a favor, if they are willing, would one of them follow the path of a wagon that passed not too long ago with an unconscious man in the back of it, and if they could show me.</p> <p>After some time, <a href="/marshbout/creatures/ash_the_crow.html">Ash the Crow</a> flies down. &quot;I am Ash, do you have The Sparklies?&quot; Flick pulls out a lot of shiny bronze currency with a hole punched in the middle of it.</p> <p>Ash steps gingerly over and pokes at them forcefully. &quot;These will do nicely. Ka-Kaw!&quot; Seven other crows come down and grab a piece. Ash, pieceless, comes to Flick's shoulder and rests his head against hers. &quot;You may proceed with your incantation.&quot;</p> <p>And she whispers in sylvan 'May your sight be mine though your will remains your own' to cast Beast Sense to sense through their sensorium.</p> <p>Flick: Please find my friend and many more shinies will be yours.</p> <p>Flick can tell that Ash can smell Jean-Luc, and acts somewhat like a bloodhound, picking up scents, then flying low to the ground and quickly. (For Flick, it's &quot;slightly disorienting to have two streams of experience, but she can get used to it&quot; and says &quot;well wherever JL's been taken, it must be some kind of compound, or house, out here, Ash will be able to give us the lowdown on it. But to make the best use of our time we should follow behind.&quot;</p> <h3 id="the-horse-trough"><a href="#the-horse-trough" class="header-anchor">#</a> The horse trough</h3> <p>Knowing that Flick is a ranger, he's not all that worried, since they haven't used magic to track anyone, so doesn't think the Amulet will prevent their efforts.</p> <p>JL: I get it, you captured me and tied me up, I respect that, kind of, but I'm thirsty, could you get me some water. And maybe another one of those Kriobolitan sausages.</p> <p>TV: What sausages? but as for the water, yes, I can accommodate. (She picks up the back of his chair and spins it on a leg, and dunks his head into the water of the trough back there.)</p> <blockquote><p>CON save.</p></blockquote> <p>He sees this coming and holds his breath</p> <blockquote><p>Investigation check. How much is her pretending to be a hard-boiled thief, and how much is her being a trust-fund kid in over her head?</p></blockquote> <p>As she approached him, she was trying to keep herself from getting wet, and the natural action of pulling him back out of the trough covers her in water.</p> <p>JL settles in, knowing they've dealt with scarier foes, and waits for his friends to arrive. Tishara misreads his endurance as scared silence.</p> <p>&quot;I can see that cowed you,&quot; she says, &quot;as I would expect, for someone who's had such a soft upbringing as yourself.&quot;</p> <p>JL plays into it: Yeah, i'm sure my friends will give you whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.</p> <blockquote><p>Performance / Deception to lower her guard. it works.</p></blockquote> <p>She looks like she relaxes a bit. &quot;Yes, that's what I thought. I guess we'll have to see what happens if they show up.&quot; And she leaves the stall.</p> <p>JL goes about loosening his bonds. He easily gets the ropes off of him. His equipment is nowhere to be seen. He cautiously approaches a window and looks out around the estate. He can see directly down the path towards Sandford. He can see some of the masts in the harbor; he's about 10 miles outside the town. Between him and there is a large horse pastrure; off to the right there is a guest house; the main house curves around to the right and back. Off to his left the Strigge River gives more context to the scene.</p> <p>He tears a bit of his white shirt off, ties it outside the window, and re-ties his own ropes to make it look like he's secured.</p> <h3 id="may-glob-be-with-you"><a href="#may-glob-be-with-you" class="header-anchor">#</a> May Glob be with you</h3> <p>By this point, the group is within 2 miles of the estate. Ash comes back and rests on Flick's shoulder. &quot;Before my speech is no longer as yours, tell me what you saw.&quot;</p> <p>Ash: I must thank you again for the sparklies. It appears the trail continues straight from here; we've wound through a few fields but it is a straight line; you should see in the distance an estate; i believe that is where the carriage has ended up.</p> <p>Flick: Did you see any men bearing steel beaks or crow killers? (That's how they understand bows and swords, says Flick to herself)</p> <p>Ash: If you'll give me just a few moments; he flies upwards in a spiral. Unfortunately, I agreed to this service, but I'm a bit of an elder crow and my vision isn't what it used to be; it was tough for me to see how many were milling about the estate. I saw not a few shapes. Be careful.</p> <p>Flick: We always are. (And gives him three more coins)</p> <p>Ash: A true bounty! I will remember you. How do you call yourself in the crow language?</p> <p>Flick makes a bunch of clicks and caws.</p> <p>Ash: the clicks could use some work, but I get the gist.</p> <p>Flick: Well I don't speak it very often</p> <p>Ash: No, you shouldn't be embarrassed; very few do; but if you ever wish to learn the language, we do consider one of our sites of power to be Wrentop which, yes, is named for wrens, but we kind of co-habitate it, and feel free to visit any time, there is much room after a great exodus of some of the creatures there about a year ago, and we would love to repopulate.</p> <p>Flick: What happened at Wrentop?</p> <p>Ash: There was a distant explosion, and it drew like a magnet some who lived under the ground there, and they went to investigate and did not return to the hills.</p> <p>Flick: Thank you, I won't forget this.</p> <p>Ash: May Glob be with you.</p> <p>Flick: And also with you.</p> <h3 id="crossing-old-five-clan-road"><a href="#crossing-old-five-clan-road" class="header-anchor">#</a> Crossing Old Five Clan Road</h3> <p>Flick: Well, there isn't no one at the estate, but we should be able to take them. What do you say we teach these guys not to mess with us.</p> <p>Jaap: You bet, let's get them.</p> <p>Flick: Alright, I like the spirit!</p> <blockquote><p>Flick Perception 2 miles away</p></blockquote> <p>Pjorg, lost in his ledger, isn't good at tracking, and also doesn't care, he's just going beacuse it's interesting. He's also done enough eye-pushups that he's able to see slightly further than he otherwise would be able to. (And he has higher resolution because his &quot;ocular&quot; has been shrunken down into a smaller &quot;retina&quot;.)</p> <p>The estate is not built to blend into its surroundings. They can't anymore details that there are a grouping of buildings nestled in a crook of the river. There are trees to the east and west, but in between it's very nice horse pasture.</p> <p>And, as Pjorg believes, Ys is flat. And it's runes all the way down.</p> <p>Flick doesn't shun people for incorrect opinions.</p> <p>They come across <a href="/marshbout/locations/Old_Five_Clan_Road.html">Old_Five_Clan_Road</a>; the old dwarven road leading to the coast.</p> <blockquote><p>CHA saves from Vengeancea and Flick. Flick fails.</p></blockquote> <p>As Flick steps onto the road, and immediately everything around her goes grey and foggy, as though she's been transported to the ethereal plane. Vengeance sees that the blades of his selfkiller start to glow with an intense yellow-white light; but as soon as the glow peaks in intensity, it dims again to a rusty grey.</p> <blockquote><p>Jaap insight ++. Drav rolls --</p></blockquote> <p>To those watching, Flick disappeared. Jaap doesn't suspect that there are forces immediately looking to kidnap Flick. Pjorg doesn't think he's been ambushed again. Drav is still obsessed with the rocks around here, of which she's found a few good ones, without getting any whispers back; tldr she is unaware that Flick has disappeared.</p> <p>As soon as things go grey, Flick looks behind her. Her companions look like Take On Me drawings, verry foggy and out of focus. She can't feel the &quot;doorway in her head&quot; feeling that she can open and get back into the prime, but she's not feeling it right now. (Based on Flick's limited experimentation, the Ethereal Plane is like a series of infinite perpenticular pocket planes that infinitely overlap and are perpendicular to the prime, but only extend a certain distance in any particular direction. So she couldn't walk over to the estate.)</p> <blockquote><p>The DM clarifies that Flick would be able to travel to the estate, or a distance, and that walking through the plane is continuous, but the person travels with a sort of &quot;fog of war&quot; or spotlight following them.</p></blockquote> <p>Where her foot landed, though, on the road, is a brilliant, glittering, silver imprint of her foot (also known as a footprint). As she looks south and north, she sees that the road boundaries are a similar, if more muted, version of that argent luminosity.</p> <p>Flick crosses the road and steps off it; nothing changes in her general environment.</p> <blockquote><p>Drav fails arcana ability check. CON save.</p></blockquote> <p>Drav takes a break from probing the stones to look up at where Flick had been. She sees footprints showing up in the dirt and dust of the Old Five Clan Road. To her they present as golden footprints. As they solidify and then fade out, she hears a myriad of voices which sound like ancient, deep dwarven voices speaking in antiphony (call and response between two equal-sized groups, almost). Drav is overwhelmed by this, and passes out and flops over.</p> <blockquote><p>Jaap medicine check (20)</p></blockquote> <p>Jaap comes over and examines Drav who, though physically unharmed, yet, in addition to having fainted, bears the superficial signs of an intense psychological conflict (in his view, perhaps, having tapped into some kind of collective unconscious).</p> <p>Jaap brings out his favorite caterpillar urine salts. As the acrid scents make their way into her nose and sensorium, she sees herself as if from above sitting at the edge of the road as and endless column of dwarves marches northwards past her. They wear clothing she's never seen before except in old tomes where she's researched the armor from past ages, thousands of years ago. Drav reaches out in an attempt to make contact, but her arm passes through the figures. As she continues watching, suddenly panic contorts their features, and they begin to run. The road further south suddenly buckles and warps and rises up in huge ribbons of sand-colored flesh, and a gigantic maw of some kind of snake or dragon lunges towars her and the dwarves.</p> <p>She wakes up to see in focus a caterpillar butt and Jaap behind, holding it. (By accident, Jaap was infected with a caterpillar virus that gave him certain extra caterpillar glands in his armpits.)</p> <blockquote><p>Flick Perception 21</p></blockquote> <p>She's looking at the road and back towards the group and casts detect portal. She gets a case of goosepimples; when she turns around. Because of the distance, in the Ethereal Plane, she couldn't make out what was going on, but the magnitude strikes her. She sees a helix of energy rising into the air from a little hill off to the side of the estate. In the helix, she sees this, blasting a path towards her eyes through the fog of the EP, the other strand looks like it's drawing life and color and energy from the material plane. At the very top it looks like an upside-down tornado that converges up in the atmosphere. The more she looks, the more it looks like a hurricane.</p> <p>Is it a nexus point for a ton of different planes? No. At this point, the boundary between the material plane and the ethereal plane has been eradicated, at the tip of that inverted tornado.</p> <p>Flick believes she was pulled into the ethereal plane, that planar overlap is extending weakly out from that point. She tries to &quot;step rigt next to her friends&quot; on the material planes, hoping to maybe piggyback on this boundary erasure. (like straining to attend to a single voice in a loud room).</p> <blockquote><p>She &quot;accidentally&quot; uses Misty Step to do this.</p></blockquote> <p>Flick finds herself stepping into the material plane. She waves at her friends in a bemused and slightly terrified show of good humor. Pjorg lets out a hearty chuckle: &quot;oh small one, you became so small that we couldn't see you. Tell me, what's it like to see everything so large?&quot;</p> <p>Flick: It's really something Pjorg, she says, chuckling in an exaggerated show of good humor. Pjorg: Indeed, I describe many things as something. Flick: Almost everything is something. Pjorg: But some things are not. Something means everything to me.</p> <p>Flick immediately turns her attention back to the point where the helix was in the material plane. She perceives the area as slightly out of focus, but for the most part it looks like a large grassy hill with significant bald spots on it, behind a sprawling estate.</p> <p>I certainly think Jean-Luc is in some particular danger, FLick says, and takes off towards the estate.</p> <p>Pjorg takes a minute, because he's seen runeslätingar perform &quot;The Stony Step&quot; and jump between two rocks with runes on them. He's unable to see runes of that nature when he closely examines the points of Flick's appearance and disappearance. He does think, tho, that maybe one of the stones had a rune carved, but he would be very hard pressed to tell what it was.</p> <p>Drav investigates the stones too.</p> <p>Don't bother looking, dwarf, there's nothing there, Pjorg says cocksurely in an attempt to obviate the search.</p> <p>Despite Pjorg's supercilious handwaving, Drav sees the [&lt;T] symbol, the one identified with Ten-Axe Bloodsledge in the Archives, carved into a great number of the rocks forming the outer edges of the road. She gets the feeling it may have been a protective magic against the dragon, or the Desert ecosystem itself. She also sees the pong [ ] symbol carved into a few of the rocks on the interior of the road. Pjorg has never seen this before, and neither has Drav.</p> <p>Pjorg thinks: this is obscure-on-obscure shit, off the beaten path (though not literally), so it's understandable that he doesn't recognize it.</p> <p>Vengeance takes a look at his self-killer as it glows, likewise seeing a [ ] symbol, A RUNE SO PROFOUND, the open-triangle pinwheel, the auto-rune, the logo, that looks similar to the self-killer itself, and the wings with eyes. Flick is hustling pretty hard by now for Jean-Luke. The winglike symbol looks very familiar to Vengeance on a religion check.</p> <p>(Flick remembers that the fish taco Flick bought had a delicious taste profile, incorporating saffron foam. )</p> <p>I feel like Jean-Luc should be looking (luc-ing?) for us, Vengeance claims. Is it really our responsibility to go looking for him every time he disappears. ALL THE TIMES. Something tells me he's not doing his berst to escape and find us. I don't know. Maybe he could be trying a little harder.</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div> <hr class="footnotes-sep"> <section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>shaped like a sausage <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>alley <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>small courtyard <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/hafdon/obsidian-general/edit/main/sessions/recaps/session_053-Hogdorg.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help improve the page?</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
