Flick hatches a plan to pop Jaap<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> into the other plane with her, and have Jaap Dimension-Door the creature out. They Walk in, and eyes-wide-open Jaap catches a vision of an <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/aspect.html">aspect</a> of <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/garl_glittergold.html">The Trickster</a>, an informal gardener with a dangerous looking spade who injoins him to &quot;take care&quot; of Titi, the nightcrawler.</p> <p>Meanwhile Ojorg enlists Drav in clearing his back of icicles as though he were a gutter; this puts the &quot;evocative&quot; wizard in a position to notice some kind of witchery accelerating his defrostation. And now fairly close to Drav, Ojorg freely notices and expatiates on the complex and curious patterns of knots in Drav's scarf.</p> <p>Flick, Jaap, and Gargan immerge<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> into the Material Plane, <em>globspeed</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>; the manner in which Gargan's wings and limbs hang about her causes her to resemble a stringless marionette. Even a cautious attempt to offer succour from the cleric liquefies the flesh of the rescuee; and, surmising things will not be getting better any time soon, Gargan-shadow is resorbed by Gargan-body.  Almost instantly her body begins to seize and emit a death-ruttle<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>; Flick astutely notices that the ring is strobing in time with Gargan's convulsions, and in a desperate effort slips the ring onto one of the sufferer's phalanges.</p> <p>Gargan awakes and without delay clutches a strange fork-shaped stone and utters some occult words. Yet, before whatever is going to happen happens, Jean-Luc leaps forward and knocks the object away. While the stranger maintains that she was merely on her way to a &quot;family grilling party,&quot; Jean-Luc's body frosts over and he is lost to a nightmarish vision of unadulterated and dreadful raddour.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Flick sprints over to Protect (from Evil) Jean-Luc, as Jaap gets Gargan into an arm-lock before she can recover the fork. Un-fork-unately she's able to teleport to the fork, grabs it, and sprints away, only to be lured back into an empathetic conversation about family relations with Jean-Luc.</p> <p>Flick, fed up, invokes her own little <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/distant_strike.html">space-skip</a> to close the distance to Gargan and explodes the latter's body into a puddle before the <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/m-star-griller.html">M-Star Griller</a> can jump planes. Jaap, hoping to clean things up, dismisses whatever magic might still attend to Jean-Luc; however, the impetuous elf imprudently clutches the fork, drops it into her sack, and turns around, only to be greeted by the incoherent meins of huge hulking insects dripping with inky sludge, and also Pjorg.</p> <h2 id="transcript"><a href="#transcript" class="header-anchor">#</a> transcript</h2> <h3 id="strategizing-the-rescue"><a href="#strategizing-the-rescue" class="header-anchor">#</a> Strategizing the rescue</h3> <p><a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Gargan.html">Gargan</a>'s body remains trapped in the Ethereal Plane.</p> <p><a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Flick.html">Flick</a> knows that this icy-hot goo exists both in the Material and Ethereal plans and is trapping Gargan. Moving, in the real world, what's trapping her in the Ethereal Plane will free her, she thinks. And she knows that if she concentrates hard enough she can pull someone into the EP with her. -- <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/jaap_jansen.html">Jaap</a>, if I did that with you, and you did that with dimension door, you'd re-emerge from the EP when it ended for me, a few seconds later.</p> <p>Flick tries to recall exactly where Gargan's unconscious body was, but doesn't remember <a href="/obsidian-general/language/turr-shit.html">turr-shit</a>.</p> <h3 id="drav-s-discoveries"><a href="#drav-s-discoveries" class="header-anchor">#</a> Drav's discoveries</h3> <p><a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Drav.html">Drav</a> meanwhile sees that the icy goo around <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/ojorg_sweetleaf.html">Ojorg</a> is melting faster than it is elsewhere. His skin is also beginning to pinken just slighty as it warms, though it remains a deep cobalt blue.</p> <p>Drav starts to scrape some of the icicles off him, and, at his behest, goes to clear them from his back as well; there's not much to do, though a few stragglers do hang from his ears.</p> <p>She notices as she passes her hand over his back that there's a spot that is actually radiating warmth. The tingling feeling that she had last time refricates, and Drav is put in mind of the <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/devils_mark.html">devil's mark</a> she once had; occasionally when she awakens from certain nightmares she can't recall she still gets a goosepimply feeling.</p> <p>Drav wonders if the ink demon and the creature inside the scroll are related. She remembers from her reading that the ink demon isn't drawn to spells, but the two pipsqueaks are probably in the same category.</p> <h3 id="flick-gives-a-trigonometry-lesson"><a href="#flick-gives-a-trigonometry-lesson" class="header-anchor">#</a> Flick gives a trigonometry lesson</h3> <p>Flick stands in the middle of the dome, crouches, and shakes her head. Jaap is pretty sure Flick has no idea where Gargan's body is, and says &quot;Maybe I can go in at the bottom floor and, with Blink, can locate her in those strobing bursts.&quot;</p> <p>Flick can't use her Ethereal Steps, but can use Etherealness. Jaap assumes that Dimension Door would work in the same way on the EP and, in preparation, he walks around the building to mark the spots of ingress and egress from the plane. It takes Jaap a while to find secure footing, but he gets a good idea of the circumference of the rubble and feels confident he'll be able to describe his destinations accurately.</p> <p>In case anyone is wondering, Jean-Luc is conspicuously <strong>not</strong> a part of the rescue mission.</p> <h3 id="walking"><a href="#walking" class="header-anchor">#</a> Walking</h3> <p>Flick blusters confidence as to where she remembered seeing Gargan's body and comes over to Jaap. The elf and the gnome awkwardly embrace in an open hug, and Flick whispers an elven proverb that translates to <em><a href="/obsidian-general/language/wherever_you_go_there_you_are.html">wherever_you_go_there_you_are</a></em> She closes her eyes (as she always does when she <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/horizon-walking.html">Walks</a>).</p> <p>Jaap, however, steadfastly keeps his eyes wide open, expecting to see some meretricious transitional details such as <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/nissi_whistle_pummleaf.html">Nissi Whistle-Pummleaf</a> might have painted for a backdrop. What he sees is that everything around him drains of color; --in the Ethereal Plane, different shapes acquire solidity, though the plane itself always looks washed out. He briefly sees a figure, standing approximately where the <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/species/nightcrawler.html">nightcrawler</a> emerged from the soil. The figure appears to be a gnome, slightly on the tall side, wearing white overalls, a wide-brimmed wideawake hat, bare feet, and a fork-spade gardening tool. She turns towards Jaap, gives him an awkward wink-blink with a nod to Flick's misattempt, and fades out as the cleric manifests fully on the EP.</p> <p>Flick and Jaap almost immediately locate Gargan's body. Flick doesn't consult Jaap, but shouts &quot;There is it!&quot; She embraces Jaap around the shoulders, kicks for thrice her body length straight to the body, (Flick has been describing the different beween the EP and the MP unconsciously under her breath as she builds up speed to propel Jaap forwards) and pushes the cleric towards Gargan, kicking back up to where she started after they separate.</p> <p>He coasts towards the body, pushes a little slower than he'd like, sliding and rocking down to Gargan's unconscious body. &quot;Ah, cool -- a new way of movement here,&quot; he thinks. The <em>lentissimo</em> progress he ascribes largely to the unexpected viscosity of the goop in the Ethereal Plane.</p> <p>Jaap reaches out, and his hand squishes into Gargan's body like grabbing a sack of rice. He pops into the subterranean tunnel of Dimension Door, and can see for the first time the extent of Gargan's injuries, which include two broken wings and a limp, useless arm.</p> <p>As he travels further through the dimensional tunnel, he sees the other gnome again. This time she appears to be hovering in one of the other passages. Jaap is confident that she connected somehow to <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/garl_glittergold.html">Garl Glittergold</a>. Perhaps she is one of the Aureate God's aspects. &quot;Take care of my little friend,&quot; she whispers as he passes by.</p> <p>Will do! Jaap replies. What's his name? Already fading out, the gardener says, &quot;It's <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Titi.html">Titi</a>,&quot; and she returns to digging furrows in the ground.</p> <p>Flick meanwhile sees Jaap and Gargan disappear (&quot;<a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Glob.html">Globspeed</a>, little gnome!&quot;). She times her return to the Material Plane with clearing the plateau of debris, and lands more or less where she started out. She runs to the lip of the plateau to see if Jaap appears with Gargan.</p> <h3 id="gargan-triage"><a href="#gargan-triage" class="header-anchor">#</a> Gargan triage</h3> <p>Jaap examines her; her injuries will require more than mere healing; both of her wings are completely snapped in half and the arm that looked dislocated is definitely broken. Being this close to her, though, he notices a strange feeling: the one he gets when he's around the undead. Indeed, he can see, almost like a persistent negative of the sun when one closes one's eyes, the emblazoned axe, his holy symbol, on the front of his shield glow dimly.</p> <p>Chary of his healing powers having the opposite effect on a creature tha activates his holy symbol, he reaches out and touches her on the tip of her wing with the most mild healing energy possible. Even this, though, is too much, and he startles as Gargan's skin liquefies to a <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/substances/ichor.html">black ichor</a> under his finger, and from the shadow-double issues an otherworldly screech of pain.</p> <p><em>Stop, stop!</em> he hears. Perhaps the pain, or Jaap's touch, has allowed her secondhand telepathy to reach him as well.</p> <p>That's fine by me, I'll stop. I'm just trying to make you feel better here. This always works for everybody else? Why don't you like this?</p> <p>It hurts me just as much as your outright attempts to kill me, Gargan hisses.</p> <p>Maybe we need to talk a little bit about where you're from and who your friends are, then, Jaap chuckles.</p> <p>Ah, hah, no, it's been a long time since I had friends.</p> <p>My religious knowledge tells me that you must be some sort of undead or have an evil aspect.</p> <p>I'm <em>not</em> one of the undead, she maintains.</p> <p>The duplicate leaps into the air and wings slowly to Jaap and its body. &quot;I'm not sure how wise it would be to dismiss this shadow and return to my body,&quot; it says. &quot;If I can already feel this much pain, even disconnected, it's going to be horrendous.&quot; She pauses. &quot;But given that,&quot; the shadow points to the spot on the wing that's still cavitating<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> slightly, &quot;I doubt you're going to be able to reduce the pain.&quot;</p> <p>Jaap: No, nope, I don't think so. There used to be a spell I could use in situations like this, but I wouldn't be able to provide any help right now.</p> <p>Gargan: Well, thank you for pulling me out of there, in any case.</p> <h3 id="reunited"><a href="#reunited" class="header-anchor">#</a> Reunited</h3> <p>The shadow straddles the body, facing its feet, and sits back into it like lying down on a bed. Her figure shimmers, and unites, and immediately her body begins to pant raggedly, as one might expect of an animal in great pain. Her eyes remain closed as her body starts to twitch violently.</p> <p>Jaap fumbles for what to do.</p> <p>Jean-Luc shouts, &quot;Does anyone know medicines? <strong>Because I don't!</strong>&quot; Flick thinks about how ill-qualified she is for this.</p> <p>Drav asks Flick if she has any more <a href="/obsidian-general/items/goodberries.html">goodberries</a>; unfortunately Flick has given all her jam away.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: I do have <em>poison</em>, if we're just going by &quot;opposites.&quot;</p> <p>Flick: Well she's not undead, but she's almost undead when it comes to healing.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: Yeah, I think we need a necromancer.</p> <p>Jaap: I'd think the opposite of Healing Wounds would be Inflict Wounds; I could try that like I tried Cure Wounds.</p> <p>Drav recalls that she has in her possession the <a href="/obsidian-general/items/spellbooks.html">spellbooks</a> of <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Riult.html">Riult</a> and <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Feniendum.html">Feniendum</a>, both of whom were at least necromancy-adjacent.</p> <p>Jean-Luc, despite having no basis for understanding any of this, is still a thief and takes notice of more material objects. He spots that Gargan is clutching in her unbroken hand <a href="/obsidian-general/items/twinning_fork.html">a large spit-roast fork</a> made of a very familiar black rock, both dusty and oily, pitted and shiny, that looks exactly like the huge meteorite at the Vernix Estate.</p> <p>Jaap and Flick recognize that the symptoms Gargan is exhibiting, which have begun to include seizing and hissing out a death rattle, are signs of an impending death.</p> <p>Flick pulls the ring out of her bag and examines it. As she holds it in front of her, she sees an image appear within the open circle of the ring's shaft, almost like a hologram, and recognizes it as the circular emblem the teleporting assassins bore who attacked the group in <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/sandford.html">Sandford</a> during Jean-Luc's abduction.</p> <p>Flick can't tell anything about its magic potential, but it does seem to be flickering in time with Gargan's seizures. Self-serving rationalizations come into Flick's head: Gargan did attack her unprovoked, but she is obviously suffering. Flick runs over, grabs &quot;the ring finger&quot; analogue, and slides on the ring. Gently folding the creature's hand around it, she clasps Gargan's hand in hers, even though it's on the broken arm. (Flick's a little anthropocentric and ignores Gargan's toes.)</p> <p>The demonic creature's eyes open. It's difficult to tell that they are unfocused, since she has solid black demon eyes. Gargan turns her head towards Flick and mutters, &quot;Oh, I didn't know you were a sister.&quot; As determinedly as she's able, her good hand clutches the fork tightly and begins to whisper a spell.</p> <p>Jean-Luc, undoubtedly the quickest of the bunch, leaps forwards and knocks the fork out of her hand before the spell completes. Gargan's eyes open -- &quot;What?!&quot; -- It's clear that she did not expect to still be here. &quot;You give me my ring but take away my fork?&quot;</p> <h3 id="grilling-party"><a href="#grilling-party" class="header-anchor">#</a> Grilling party</h3> <p>Jean-Luc: We just wanted to talk to you for a second.</p> <p>Gargan: I was on my way to a family barbeque! We just talked about this!</p> <p>Jean-Luc: I guess we are the bad guys.</p> <p>Jaap intuits that Gargan <em>was</em> changing planes, but could very well have been going to family, or at least those who could help her.</p> <p>Jaap and Jean-Luc both ask to accompany her, as they love a good party.</p> <p>I'm not sure you would be welcome there, she says. I can only take myself, and even then only if you give me back the meatfork.</p> <p>Flick tries to determine quickly if the ring has done its rejuvenative work and if she's safe to remove it, but she can't tell from here. Flick wonders if anything like destiny or fate is associated with the ring, but doesn't think so.</p> <h3 id="twinning-fork"><a href="#twinning-fork" class="header-anchor">#</a> Twinning fork</h3> <p>As the fork is knocked out of Gargan's hand, and Flick wonders if she's fated to have the ring. Drav continues to be distracted by Ojorg who's still fixated on her scarf, pointing out an interesting pattern of knots.</p> <p>Meanwhile, when Jean-Luc touches the fork he is immediately riddled with deep frost, slumping back into an L-shape, to all appearances frozen solid. Only Jaap and Flick see, at the very edge of their vision, a figure alike to Jean-Luc down to the finest detail appear as if from nowhere, look briefly in their direction, and stride insouciantly away.</p> <h3 id="madness"><a href="#madness" class="header-anchor">#</a> Madness</h3> <p>Jean-Luc finds himself falling into a dark void. He feels an immense cold, hundreds of times colder than the Library. From a great distance he can see an imprint of himself, on the boundary of the void, unflatten from the sphere like a pancake being stapula'ed from a pan, and inflate, held together during the process like a wooden marionette. It hesistates momentarily while the final signs of life pervade its form: a warming, reddening skin, lively motions, an animated face. And then it disappears.</p> <p>Immediately he begins to hear insane whispers, and, though he's been held in torture or hazed with a bag over his head, this is ontologically different. As the whispers evolve to screams, each one stabs his mind like a needle, and he is overcome by fear. He is fear, and the source of that fear surrounds him. A desperate urge to flee overtakes him, but can have no outlet, as he is hemmed in entirely. Slimy yet dusty tentacles brush up against his leg.</p> <h3 id="knot-talk"><a href="#knot-talk" class="header-anchor">#</a> Knot-talk</h3> <p>Ojorg brings to Drav's (historical) attention that there was a group that used to communicate using the knotting and loops in woven materials; they intentionally forewent the written word, as this was another physical medium that could last through time. It seems as though some of those patterns are woven into this scarf.</p> <p>Drav: Can you tell me what it means?</p> <p>Ojorg: Well I was only a dilettante, but with some time the both of us could puzzle it out.</p> <h3 id="out-of-the-frosting-pan"><a href="#out-of-the-frosting-pan" class="header-anchor">#</a> Out of the frosting pan</h3> <p>Flick drops Gargan's hand with a feeling of immense betrayal. She rushes to Jean-Luc and brackets his head with her hands and &quot;supercasts&quot; Protection from Evil. She gets a kind of feedback through her hands that Jean-Luc has been beset by not the normal manichaean evil, but aberrational evil.</p> <p>In his trapped void, Jean-Luc sees a flattened, two-dimensional projection of Flick spread itself against the bowl-like side of the void, and then her three-dimensional hand bursts through and pulls him from the darkness. He's still shivering with cold, icicles hanging from his nose, chin and even eyelashes, and frost adorning every other surface. But fortunately, though the fear lingers, he no longer feels the urge to flee.</p> <p>Seeing Jean-Luc awake, Flick gives a sigh of relief, kisses him on his forehead, and runs back over to Gargan's body.</p> <p>&quot;Weirdly nurturing of Flick,&quot; Jean-Luc thinks as he offers a trembling thanks.</p> <h3 id="difficult-is-just-a-word"><a href="#difficult-is-just-a-word" class="header-anchor">#</a> Difficult is just a word</h3> <p>Spying Gargan making a play for the fork, Jaap harnesses the wily athleticism common to <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/species/gnomes.html">gnomes</a> and leaps for her arm as she stretches out along the spongy ground. He gets a good hold and, with thirty pounds of armor aiding his efforts, holds her arm back as he shouts for help.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Gargan remembers she's wearing the ring. She teleports the few feet to the fork, grabs it, and runs down the slope as fast as her broken body will allow. Jean-Luc sprints towards her in order to stab her in the back. He has no sympathy for this creature.</p> <p>I can't believe I tried to help you, you piece of shit! I used my Etherealness on you! Flick shouts. I can't do that more than once a day!</p> <p>I just wanted to help you, Gargan says, I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't know that you would try to touch the fork. You should only touch it if you are an <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/m-star-griller.html">M-Star Griller</a> -- it allows me to teleport.</p> <h3 id="a-fruitless-interrogation"><a href="#a-fruitless-interrogation" class="header-anchor">#</a> A fruitless interrogation</h3> <p>Jean-Luc: I'm assuming you made some kind of bargain with an ancient one?</p> <p>Gargan: It's less a bargain with an evil one than the family you're born into.</p> <p>Oddly, Jean-Luc understands this. &quot;Yeah, you don't get to choose your allies or your family. BTW, do you want to stop running so I can hear you out?&quot; Somehow this desperate plea from Jean-Luc appears to work.</p> <p>Still backing up slowly, she hisses: <em>What is it</em> that you want?</p> <p>Jean-Luc fumbles a bit. &quot;Well, my name's Jean-Luc and โฆ we're obviously from another planet, and we owe a debt to our friend here (indicating <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Startrella.html">Startrella</a>) that we're trying to repay.&quot;</p> <p>Gargan: We're in remarkably similar circumstances, as I'm also from a different plane and I owe my allegiance to another group.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: Maybe we can help each other. Do you know anything about The Infestation?</p> <p>Gargan: I don't know what the infestation is that you're talking about.</p> <p>Jean-Luc proceeds to give a brief description of <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/k-krut.html">K'krut</a> and the demon-bug that had incubated in Pilzzt.</p> <p>Gargan: I've encountered things like that; some of the less pleasant demons and devils conduct themselves in that way; I can tell you think of me as one of them, but I live a cleaner life.</p> <p>What about those spiders? Jean-Luc asks.</p> <p>I came here due to the residual teleportation magic, Gargan replies, the spiders were probably drawn to it in a similar way. As happens around these kinds of doorways, life begins to change and mutate, and not always for the better.</p> <p>Then what brings <em>you</em> here, Jean-Luc counters.</p> <p>As I've said, it's an <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/oases.html">oasis</a> between plane hopping.</p> <p>Where is this a portal <em>to</em>, Jaap asks. What did it do, and what did it connect to?</p> <p>It doesn't connect to anything anymore, that I know of, Gargan says. It probably used to connect to some of the deeper recesses of the universe. Out here, Si'a used to be a kind of hinterlands, and it was possible to use portals on Si'a to leapfrog to other planets.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: Where are you from originally? Any place we might have heard of?</p> <p>Gargan: I don't think so โฆ</p> <p>Jaap approaches Ojorg. Do you recognize this creature? Ojorg replies, a bit baffled, in a <em>sotto voce</em> &quot;No, I don't know who this is. I must remind you that I've been frozen in there for quite some time. This creature showed up after I was frozen, mustbe.&quot; Meanwhile Gargan continues to back away, holding the fork up in front of her like a religious symbol or totem. Jean-Luc prepares to dodge out of the way, should she try to attack.</p> <h3 id="mathematical-tongues"><a href="#mathematical-tongues" class="header-anchor">#</a> Mathematical tongues</h3> <p>Flick shouts some elvish curses, charges forwards, reaching out with empty hands, and, as she gets to the edge of the plateau, a beam of transdimensional energy shoots out towards Gargan and envelops her, and Flick gets pulled through it, flexing her legs slightly as she goes for a thigh-and-drive tackle and with great radeur<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> forces the demonic creature to the ground.</p> <p>In this case Flick misjudges her inertia at the other end of Distant Strike, and, rather than shoot out of the teleport, she stumbles at a standstill and almost bonks heads with Gargan. The demon produces two fangs from her nesethirls and sinks them into Flick's neck. The bite feels as though it's coming both from Gargan and her echo. Looking a bit frazzled, Flick teleports back where she just was, clears her head, stands up straight, recovers her bow, and looses a force arrow.</p> <h3 id="supermurder"><a href="#supermurder" class="header-anchor">#</a> Supermurder</h3> <p>Flick, still focused on her target's midsection, feeds directly all the power of her force arrow into the center of mass of the Grill Master <em>manquรฉ</em>, exploding the body like a puddle into which someone has thrown a boulder. Luckily for the more materialistic members of the party, the ring and the fork survive the explosion, landing a few dozen feet away from the vaporized creature.</p> <p>When Gargan bit Flick, though, she had lost her concentration on Protection from Evil, and Jean-Luc is once again beset by fear. He feels the impossibly heavy, time-slowed thud of the fork against the ground as though it were an earthquake, and the sound echoes to where it sounds like a multitude of wardrums beating out the pulse of his death.</p> <p>Throw it into the fire! he screams, and makes to sprint away from the fork as fast as he can.</p> <p>Does anyone have a cocoon-shooter? Flick shouts. Meanwhile Startrella has been a bit distracted: You going for a run, Jean-Luc? Good for you, staying fit. Ojorg looks again at the scarf. You know what? I think it's coming together for me, we probably don't even need to research the knots. I could probably translate it as-is. Drav, what's got your attention, look where I'm pointing!</p> <h3 id="i-ll-remove-your-fear-with-a-handful-of-dust-or-an-epi-pen-to-the-face"><a href="#i-ll-remove-your-fear-with-a-handful-of-dust-or-an-epi-pen-to-the-face" class="header-anchor">#</a> I'll remove your fear with a handful of dust; or, An epi-pen to the face</h3> <p>Jaap recognizes immediately what's happened to Jean-Luc and casts <code>Dispell Magic</code>. Once again he sees the gardener gnome, a little hazier this time, appearing next to Jean-Luc. She grabs some dust out of a pouch and, with it heaped in her palm, blows the dust onto Jean-Luc's face. From the rogue's perspective, the slushy water-jelly still adhering to him is absorbed by what feels like thick seasonal pollen, and the whole mass falls off in thick satisfying tofu-like chunks. As it falls off, his fear falls with it. He gets a faint glimpse, or intuition, of an otherworldly figure next to him; it might even look like <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Lydia.html">Lydia</a>; but it passes away quickly and he takes it to be a hallucination of some sort. He also finds that his allergies have been cured for the moment.</p> <h3 id="there-s-always-somewhere-worse"><a href="#there-s-always-somewhere-worse" class="header-anchor">#</a> There's always somewhere worse</h3> <p>Flick walks over to the ring, picks it up, and then inadvisedly does the same with the fork. Holding it in her hand, she doesn't notice anything amiss, but on turning around, and dropping the fork into the bag, a terrifying scene greets her. Five chittering insectoid creatures of various heights, each with a riot of tentacles writhing from their heads, and a black oily substance dripping from their limbs, stare at her with vicious intent and approach her menacingly.</p> <p>Oddly enough, Pjorg remains standing at the periphery of her vision. The others, though, she thinks, must have been aberrations this whole time, which goes a long way to explain why they keep running into monsters: her companions are secret monsters too. In a way this makes too much sense.</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div> <hr class="footnotes-sep"> <section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>pop Jaap, v.
