Casting about for a suitable destination, Flick sees the fairly large town nestled on the north banks of [x] bay</p> <ul><li>Cyrowan: We should go over to Sandford, on the sandy northern banks! There's no teleportation circle there.</li></ul> <p>Paros, Fez, Cyrowan, Startrella, Carlos travel to Sandford.

They proceed for an hour, running stealthily: Flick takes a level of exhaustion. It's 11:am. Pass without trace has worn off; they are within sight of the mountains.</p> <ul><li>Flick (puffing): lets. make. ourselves. hidden.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: Nothing like running through the forest. God I miss the city. (&quot;Jean-Luc is a pampered noble who misses a soft bed and cold glass of ale at night.&quot;)</li> <li>Flick: Don't worry, we'll get there soon. We're going to be after the Tiara Mafia next.</li></ul> <p>They are no longer able to see the Tripod behind them. They can, however, see the clear blue waters of Tull Bay to their east. Sandford on the north shore, and a cluster of small villages that attend the projectionsi and island in the bay. (They are repeased[^repeased. Reassured.] to know that their companions should be safe there in the pretty sleepy villages.) History: Jean-Luc has a reliable contact, his fence, &quot;<a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Spindler.html">Spindler</a>&quot; (who does not know Jean-Luc's real name either) lives on the village on the far side, the larger and more urban of the collective-of-four. Spindler sells things to an underworld boss known as <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Jaguar.html">Jaguar</a>. All except Flick know that the city is known for its experimental artificers and laboratory technicians -- perhaps they have contacts at <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/red_fox_university.html">red_fox_university</a>? -- and suspect that tentamens<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> involving audio technology to direct undesirable soundwaves, or visuo-hallucinatory images such as scarecrows hundreds of feet tall, may protect them from the peryton and perhaps the tripods and other constructs. On the other hand, they may have been able to harness the power of naturally occurring geological magic such as [lode stones] or [ley lines], where Aphelia pointed as the location of the Peryton, is the tallest of the three</p> <ul><li><p>Jean-Luc: We're not goblins, so we should be ok.</p></li> <li><p>Flick: If it was goblins doing the smiting it would be SmiteGoblin peak?</p></li> <li><p>Jean-Luc: Jean-luc cares not for your semantic argument.</p></li> <li><p>Flick: Is anyone trepidatious about proceeding without our full complement?</p></li> <li><p>Vengeance: how outmatched are we? I've never encountered such a beast.</p></li> <li><p>Flick: I only met with it once, and it terrified me in an unnatural way. On the other hand, we really handed that Nightmare Rider his ass to him.</p></li></ul> <p>(Jean-Luc remembers getting pretty beat up in the Nightmare fight.)</p> <ul><li>Vengeance: I recall riding in on my white horse and coming to your rescue.</li></ul> <p>The group passes through grasslands and some pasture and farmland with the occasional farm. Flick approaches one of the homesteaders. She gives a general description of the Peryton, and that a village to the northwest hired us, and she's wondered if they've had livestock or people disappearing, and if they've seen this thing casting a shadow over their lands. The human farmer: &quot;It took my uncle the other week. No one particularly liked him: he was always asking for flour and sugar, we had to loan him money for his gambling; we kindof thought it was karma, but it does sound like more people who have even well-loved relatives are reporting that the bodies or organs are being taken. We know it as The Violet Shadow.&quot; Flick communicates with her sheepdog, Belavert, &quot;sounded like a glider, and it didn't scare me at all.&quot; Then it runs around everyone and sniffs them. Flick gives it some jerky, and it asks for more, and then offers to herd their sheep. &quot;Has the peryton been harassing livestock?&quot; &quot;It hasn't gone after my sheep; its shadow has passed over me and it didn't scare me at all!&quot; Flick detects a bit of bluster in the dog, and offers some fizzlecyst jerky to the farmer: &quot;This isn't going to make up for losing a hand around the farm, but I want to thank you for your time.&quot; &quot;Oh, is that some of that cave jerky -- thanks, I guess.&quot;</p> <ul><li><p>Vengeance: And if you're lying to us, we're going to come back, burn your house down, and kill everyone you love.</p></li> <li><p>Jean-Luc: Ignore him.</p></li> <li><p>Farmer: It looks like he needs a shower and a haircut.</p></li> <li><p>Vengeance: It's my standard farewell.</p></li> <li><p>Farmer: Farewell to you too, shore. Hopefully Greyson (child?) likes this jerky. Farmers here prefer stuff from the land, not under the rocks.</p></li> <li><p>Flick: It takes all kinds.</p></li> <li><p>Flick: Ok, it seems like this thing only takes humanoids.</p></li> <li><p>Jean-Luc: FUcking druids and gnoll-eating monsters.</p></li> <li><p>Flick: I think the druids got what was coming to them. [The DM reminds them that they did say have other cells.]</p></li></ul> <p>They come across a lake that sits at the foot of  <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/goblinsmite_peak.html">Goblinsmite Peak</a>. [Perception] Across the way they see a ramshackle building set back into one of the armpits of rock. There might at one point have been active paths leading to it, and they can still detect a trod path leading around the lake.</p> <ul><li>Flick: Should we make camp here first? This looks like a half-a-day-er mountain to me. Could take all (rest of) day, but with more treacherous choices might take less.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: getting there in the dark might not be the worst thing in the world</li> <li>Flick: Ideally i'd like to take it completely by surprise and get it &quot;Aphelia'd&quot; without further fuss.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: We might โฆ not โฆ have to fight it. I think we don't have to set up camp. If we hike up there it's still going to take some time to hike back down.</li> <li>Flick: True, we do have Aphelia with us, and she's not an outdoors woman. Though it's not like we'll be ascending by handholds and stuff.</li></ul> <p>Flick walks over to Mule's saddlebags and pulls out Vek's crockery. &quot;Sorry if it was rough back there, we had to beat a hasty retreat.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Vek: it's not like a dream-within-a-dream, it was more like great suspension, good hydraulics, the whole deal.</li> <li>Flick: We're getting pretty close to the peryton. How close does Aphelia have to be? For you to reunite them?</li> <li>Vek: It's preferable that, if the peryton doesn't want this, that it's unconscious and buried in some dirt that's conducive to me infiltrating me with my spirit. Aphelia should be pretty close to that dirt. Anything more than that I'll have to strain a little bit.</li> <li>Flick: Ok guys we might end up having to fight this thing. We want to catch it when it's roosting, so we should head up now, but I'm really curious about this lake hut.</li> <li>Vengeance: if anyone needs a healing hand, i've been using this severed hand as a backscratcher.</li> <li>Vek: What's that now? (and some interrogative dirt goes flying out of the vase)</li> <li>Drav: at some point we will need to rest for health and spells.</li></ul> <p>Turns out Carlos had healed them somewhat before they separated.</p> <ul><li>Flick: let's check out this shack, and maybe we could rest a spell and have aphelia play us a soothing saraband.</li></ul> <p>They come around to the shack, with a shingle announcing Stato's Den. From the outside it looks like it was probably a bar, possibly for miners. Flick hypothesizes that there are mineshafts in the mountain. Jean-Luc would know that the mountains were mined for precious minerals and metals. Definitely gold and silver; rumors that they were mined for certain gemstones valuable to sorcerers. Jean-Luc had thought that people had abandoned the mines here 10-20 years ago. Obviously there are still scavengers who come in, but organized mining has stopped.</p> <ul><li>Jean-Luc: Sometimes corporate packs up quickly enough that there's a few bottles left lying around.</li></ul> <p>Jean-Luc steps into the bar. Flick looks for a way to enter stealthily [13]. Flick is off today. The door creaks on its hinges; you peek in and see a ramshackle bar with a few tables. There's a squat stone statue in the corner, and a man behind the bartop leaning against the frame of a door leading into a back room. [Is it creepy? because the last time we walked into a nice bar there was unpleasantness.] Flick remembers from her youth a story of a dog sitting at a burning table saying to itself &quot;This is fine.&quot; But everything here seems cool. Flick knocks on the door, &quot;Hey there, you open.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Palchin: Erm, yeah, we're open. It depends what you want from us. Just beer?</li></ul> <p>Jean-Luc thinks, &quot;Ah, my people.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Palchin: It also depends on what you're willing to spend.</li></ul> <p>Jean-Luc walks into the center of the bar [Investigation low]. He sees that there is no &quot;top shelf&quot; of alcohol, there's just beer taps. The person behind the bar is human or half-elf, vaguely like Vengeance, with a receding hairline, wearing loose tattered red robes with dirty brown tunic underneath. They won't make eye contact, and they have a fleshy, undercooked, pale face.</p> <ul><li>Beer it is! says Jean-Luc.</li> <li>Vengeance: I like this guy's style. I'll take one as well.</li></ul> <p>Palchin grabs four stone-carved mugs and โฆ</p> <ul><li>Vengeance: has this bar been following us?</li></ul> <p>โฆ Flick sits down and joins Jean-Luc. Mule stays outside with Joan, but Aphelia comes in. Palchin delivers the drinks. [Perception] Drav and Flick can tell that the beer looks and smells like pure lakewater. Flick and the others sip at it. Jean-Luc has acquired a sophisticated palette, there was that one time the Gaol Maidens hazed you and took you through a fish market and made him drink the fish slurry. Vengeance, all the times your parents would do nearly the same thing and dunk his head underwater during a fishing trip. There is the homeopathic memory of fishiness to the water. But, oddly enough, it is moderately alcoholic. [Insight - is this malicious?] Flick, &quot;This very subtle piscine allure evades me.&quot; (Flick associates the taste with the stone). Jean-Luc knows that, not only is this what's usually served, but it's also as alcoholic as a beer. Flick <em>sotto voce</em> &quot;What the fuck is this?&quot; Jean-Luc: Alcohol can be distilled from different animals; they made it from fish. I've had worse.</p> <ul><li>Palchin: There's certainly no greater compliment than having it said of one's beer that someone has &quot;had worse.&quot; If I could shake the hand of the man who said that.</li></ul> <p>Jean-Luc reaches out his hand. As he goes to shake his hand, Palchin's tray spills a bit of lake water onto the Lydia sword. (&quot;No big deal; things get a little splashed.&quot;, and goes to wipe it down. - It looks a little duller in places, but nothing to worry about. But on second glance, it almost perfectly matches the water spots.) Jean-Luc whispers to Flick, &quot;Maybe stop drinking; something might be up with this guy.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Vengeance: DO you happen to have a swish-bucket? Something that I can spit out into? I like to swish it around in my mouth a little bit, make sure I'm getting all the notes.</li> <li>Palchin: All the 'notes'? You think this is some sort of musical beer?</li> <li>Vengeance: I'm detecting a bit of sturgeon, perhaps some pike -- what kind of fish are you using exactly?</li> <li>Palchin: FIsh? no, we use the mountain lakewater here to brew the beer. If you can detect that, you have a very sensitive palette.</li> <li>Vengeance: I grew up with fish, and they have a familiar taste to me.</li> <li>Palchin: Oh, a kindred fisherman. I grew up fishing too. I just assumed that that smell sticks to you and affects everything you taste and smell from then on.</li> <li>Vengeance: I'm no fisherman. It's kind of you to say that.</li> <li>Palchin: then why do you have all these fish hooks stuck into your fingers?</li> <li>Vengeance: I had forgotten about those. This is a little bit of ornamentation.</li> <li>Palchin: We don't go for that sort of urban decoration around here. Just bread and beer folks. When you're in the mines, you don't want any extra metal on you. you never know if a spark could turn you into dust.</li> <li>Flick: You're talking like mining is still going on.</li> <li>Palchin: Mining, yeah. ALl the miners still come in after their shifts for drinks.</li> <li>Flick: I was going to ask why you were still here. We've been sent to investigate a presence casting a dark shadow over this mountain. [Insight 16]</li> <li>Palchin: Shadowy presence? No, definitely not. (His eyes dart back and forth; he's hiding something, certainly.)</li></ul> <p>Flick is distracted by the smell of stonefish and looks down just as Palchin's eyes betray him. Vengeance sees small divots in the wooden flooring where it's worn through to the mountain rock (that he could use as an expectorative receptacle). Jean-Luc is certain that this is not part of any criminal syndicate, outpost or not. This guy might not even know that some of the major recent historical events have occurred.</p> <ul><li>Palchin: is this all you want?</li></ul> <p>Vengeance goes to spit the swished beer into Palchin's โฆ mouth! Perhaps luckily, the attempt goes past his face. &quot;Well if you don't have a spittoon I'm not sure where I should be spitting. I apologize; I haven't been out in the real world for a while.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Palchin: spitting in this place indicates that you despise the brew, or are about to get into an altercation</li> <li>Vengeance: On the contrary , it means I'm trying to appreciate the symphony of flavors. I'm trying to keep my palette clean and my head clear.</li> <li>Palchin: Oh so you really need a palette cleanser. โฆ This reminds me of an incident from my youth, in which a distillery nearby was offering samples; I took a swig and spat it back into my tasting cup. I was then forced to drink my own backwash. It's only because of that incident that I'm excusing your lack of decorum</li> <li>Vengeance: That's gross, why would you even tell us that</li> <li>Palchin: I thought I would find an empathetic ear in you but i haven't.</li> <li>Flick (to no one): yet more disdain for the working class amongst the adventuring bourgeoisie.</li></ul> <p>He brings back to Vengeance a bowl full of dried algae flakes. As he goes to offer it to Vengeance, [Dex] high on the efflorescence of fish-notes from the water, and the sense-memory it's given him of his childhood when his nimbleness was at its peak, he almost unconsciously sidesteps as Palchin spills water where Vengeance's short sword was a moment ago.</p> <ul><li>Palchin: Ah, you'll excuse me, it's been a while since i've had to retrieve a palette cleanser for a patron.</li> <li>Vengeance: well we'll see if you get any tip from us.</li> <li>Palchin: I haven't even collected the drink tab, so I wasn't hopeful.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: what is the tab</li> <li>Palchin: one silver?</li> <li>Jean-Luc (tossing a gold): with tip</li> <li>Palchin: we only take honest coin here; tip is for an economy which doesn't pay its workers equitable. With a gold you're welcome to drink as long as you'd like. We also have rooms above.</li></ul> <p>1:30 pm, ish.</p> <p>Drav, examining the stone sculpture [24], sees that it is of a squat dwarf, maybe half Drav's height. 2 or 2.5 feet tall. A female dwarf, whose eyes are set in an intense glare focused on a point 10 feet in front of itself, and its mouth is wide open as if screaming or about to scream. The quality of the stonework indicates that it is not a typical hill or mountain dwarf. This may be one of the Underdark dwarves, either who carved it, or who it's meant to resemble. it doesn't bring to mind a deity, but it looks purposive, as though not meant for worship. there are candles around it which are lit and have melted. There are flints and other rock flakes in piles or cairs nearby.</p> <p>The light beer, meant to be consumed all day in lieu of untrustworthy water, gets them reasonably happy. Flick and Vengeance can hear Palchin speaking in the back, with the occasional hissing or splashing noises audibly interpolated. Flick, looking for a believable pretext to approach the bar, surveys two pictures hung on the far wall. They are arranged such that the subjects appear to comprise part of the same body. The bottommost picture is a sea-serpent, long and thin with a head and tail; on top is a picture of a mountain lake remarkable like the one outside; the image is from the side; steam rises from the lake and the image of a woman's silhouette emerges from the lake's surface.</p> <p>Flick stands and makes a show of taking in the lake picture. As she approaches, [INT 4, WIS 8]. Flick finds herself completely paralyzed, retreating into her own mind, and is unable to experience what's going on around her. To those behind her she appears completely rigid. Drav notices this, but Vengeance is looking for locations to spit while Jean-Luc seeks to frustrate his efforts. Drav walks over to Flick and can determine her sight-line on the picture. Drav adjusts Flick's head; she still appears to be paralyzed. A glimmer of horror and ultimate confusion is apparent on her face, as though she's been confronted with something incomprehensible. Drav wonders aloud if they should skedaddle. Vengeance finishes his drink, precipitating a comfortable inebriation, walks over to the bar, and puts his shortsword onto the counter, you know, subtle-like. Oh, and he swept all the drinks off the table and shouted &quot;Enough!&quot; when standing up. [Intimidation] Quick motions are heard in the back, and Palchin peaks her head out.</p> <ul><li>What's going on here? Why is your weapon laid across the bar?</li> <li>Vengeance: do you mind if i leave it there. it's a bit uncomfortable to carry.</li> <li>Palchin: no, not at all, let me clean around your sword for you. (He soaks a rag and goes to squeeze it out near the sword. )</li></ul> <p>Vengeance grabs his hand to try to get him to squeeze the rag out into his mouth.</p> <ul><li>Palchin: this is a classic dare from my younger days. we tended to put it in a shot glass first. Which of your friends are up for the challenge? it can't just be you. i'll take you on but i thought you wanted to introduce your friends to the game.</li> <li>Vengeance: It's not a challenge, I would hate to see you waste all of that fish water.</li> <li>Palchin: oh, this isn't the brew โฆ.</li> <li>Vengeance: IS IT NOT?!</li> <li>Palchin: hey, are we going to have a problem here?</li></ul> <p>Vengeance [Perception n20] can tell it's the &quot;fish water&quot; as they have begun to call the beer (although Palchin had gone to say it wasn't) and also have a crown (supertooth), Vengeance can feel it begin to dissolve in his mouth. &quot;My supertooth! Not again!&quot;</p> <ul><li>Palchin: what happened the first time?</li> <li>Vengeance: I came up behind my mule too suddenly, and she knocked it out of my head. Just the crown part, she's quite accurate with her kicks.</li> <li>Palchin: that was her intent?</li> <li>Vengeance: Yeah, she wouldn't want me to lose an actual tooth.</li> <li>Palchin: that depends how well you treat her. do you feed her โฆ every day.?</li> <li>Vengeance: Let's not get into it. the point is, YOU don't seem to care about my supertooth, nor about your bar, if you're pouring beer onto it to clean it. Let's have it, my man.</li> <li>Palchin: your sword --- should be cleaned as well by the waters, as the bar would be. -- this is what i use for cleaning: a mouth, sword, or bar.</li> <li>Vengeance: burping twice, the classic sound of a liar!</li> <li>Palchin: it can clean a mind</li> <li>Vengeance: Everyone, this man is hiding something!</li></ul> <p>Meanwhile, Drav's furious signalling has alerted Jean-Luc to Flick's predicament. Drav goes to slap Flick, but, having to hop up, barely grazes Flick's jaw, and she doesn't react.</p> <ul><li>Jean-Luc: look, we came in here looking for a drink. I've gotta be honest, I've killed people for less, please unparalyze my friend.</li> <li>Palchin: what's the matter with your friend? i've been in the back room this whole time.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: She appears to be paralyzed. I assume that's your doing.</li></ul> <p>Palchin looks at Flick, comes around the bar, &quot;It does look that way -- I believe this should remediate things.&quot; Drav is well aware that Palchin is about to pour more of this water on your shield, and on Flick's rapier. Drav pushes Palchin back out of the way, holding her shield and flick on the other side of her body.</p> <ul><li>Palchin: I was just trying to splash some water in your friend's face! that usually wakes people up.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: She's not asleep, she's paralyzed.</li> <li>Palchin: I have night-terrors --</li> <li>Jean-Luc: One last time, what is going on here?!</li> <li>Palchin: I'm trying to serve some people in the off season. I guess I do get a little lonely. I'm sorry if I appear too aggressive. You gave me a full gold, I'm just trying to be as officious as possible.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: WHY IS MY FRIEND PARALYZED</li> <li>Palchin: Your guess is as good as mine. I think a good hearty slap would do it. The dwarf barely grazed her cheek. It looks like a bit of confusion. Strange, unaccountable things do happen on this mountain that can't be accounted for.</li></ul> <p>Drav is too focused on keeping Flick safe, ready for another splash attempt. Vengeance, with his specific connection with the weirdos of the world, is sure that Palchin is lying. Palchin knows why Flick is paralyzed, and what her condition is. Palchin may, Vengeance infers, have been a monk, and the means by which he subdues his natural reactions is monklike.</p> <ul><li>Vengeance: Jean-Luc, why don't you let me handle this. I think this matter requires a bit of delicacy. Palchin, if you don't tell us what you're up to, we're going to burn your house down and kill everybody that you love. I take that back โฆ Palchin, what monastery did you happen to study in. You seem like you might follow the ways of the Tranquil monks.</li> <li>Palchin: How did you know?</li> <li>Vengeance: I guess you could say that I'm a &quot;weirdo&quot; like yourself.</li> <li>Palchin: I wasn't going to say that, but โฆ that's up to you. But yes -- I'm a monk of the Ivory Empire. But that was decades, if not almost a hundred years ago.</li> <li>Vengeance: I seem to recall we used to play that Monastery in stickball.</li> <li>Palchin: Stickball, yes! It's been quite a while. It certainly does bring back the memories. Some of our fellow monks were lucky enough to have their limbs amputated and replaced with sticks so as to play the game in its purest form.</li> <li>Vengeance: The game has changed a lot since then. These days everyone seems to be &quot;stick-doping&quot;. It's sort of lost its lustre.</li> <li>Palchin: Stick-doping?</li> <li>Vengeance: No, like replacing their limbs with sticks. It's kind of unfair, don't you think.</li> <li>Palchin: well i think it's unfair in a religious sense, but maybe not in a physiomechanical sense. but of course, the religious sense is the most important. we're agreed there.</li> <li>Vengeance: given that the purpose of stick-ball is to be as much like a stick as you can</li> <li>Palchin: That's interesting, our monastery always had a different take on it, which was it's important to be as much like a ball impaled by a stick as possible.</li></ul> <p>Flick begins to come out of her madness, Drav betwixt her and Palchin. Flick still hears the alien words being spoken resonating in her ears, but she's been turned to look into Drav's beautiful grey eyes; grey like the mountain ranges seen from the plains, and you have a gross puffy man, dripping sweat and water, standing next to you. She shouts and leaps backwards, adopting a defensive stance and reaching for her bow.</p> <ul><li>Palchin: See, your friend is better than ever.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: doesn't explain how.</li></ul> <p>Jean-Luc [Insight n.1] feels like Palchin is making honest efforts, and, since Vengeance is going off, you might be beginning to side in part with Palchin. He advisedly delays reaching for his sword. Flick, meanwhile, is looking around for cues; seeing Jean-Luc just as puzzled, she does not know what to do.</p> <ul><li>Vengeance: Hey, barkeep, is there a bathroom back there i could use? after all that fish oil</li> <li>Palchin: you were drinking oil?</li> <li>Vengeance: no, it's great, it's not a criticism, that your drinks seem to be high in omega 3s</li> <li>Palchin: sure, like aromatic oils. well most of the miners take a leak outside. this isn't a spot that has an internal bathroom. there is a bathroom over that way (west)</li> <li>Vengeance: do you have maybe a sink back that there? I need privacy. I won't be able to go, standing outside. i'm just gonna head back there if that's ok.</li></ul> <p>Palchin does appear to reluctantly allow Vengeance to go back.</p> <ul><li>Palchin: I suppose if you do need privacyโฆ The outhouse is an enclosed structure, but it does have that little crescent-shaped window. if you wanna head to the back, immediately go right, there's a trough sink for cleaning up paint brushes. you're sure this isn't a number 2?</li> <li>Vengeance: no, just the usual water colors. If you're a fellow artist, you'll know what i mean.</li> <li>palchin: i do primarily utilitarian painting. I like to keep that sign out front fresh.</li> <li>Vengeance: oh yeah, no, that's primo work.</li> <li>palchin: i was just out there the other day working on that. keep the chains bright as the sun, and the sign level as a carpenter's level.</li> <li>vengeanceโ: i would say that's what drew us to this place</li> <li>Palchin: no, i got one: level as the palaces of Modron. don't be back there too long; a lot of people get scared, -- there are a few mannequins back there under sheets; you might think they're ghosts, but they're not, they're mannequins.</li> <li>Vengeance: It'll be just like going at home.</li> <li>Palchin: I tailor my own clothes, is why. so i have bespoke mannequins for bespoke clothes. if you're a tailor you can't sew it on yourself.</li> <li>Vengeance: yeah, no, I can't imagine a more comfortable environment in which to urinate. thank you. (And he runs into the back room)</li></ul> <p>Flick looks to Drav for some clue as to the events of the last five minutes; the wizard is just as nonplussed. Flick thinks she hears outside the main door of the bar the sound of hooves skittering and sliding. She immediately runs and looks out the door.</p> <p>In the back room, Vengeance attempts to discern the source of the slurping sounds. to the right is the trough, the mannequins covered in drop cloths are there; some paint cans and an area for repairs. there are quite a few kegs; some look empty, some full. There is a shelf of glasses and dishrags.</p> <p>Vengeance shouts from the back: &quot;I guess we're fine letting everyone in the town die while we have a drink?!&quot;</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div> <hr class="footnotes-sep"> <section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Experimental apparatus. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">โฉ๏ธ</a></p></li></ol></section></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/hafdon/obsidian-general/edit/mac/marshbout/sessions/recaps/session_039_when_in_statos_den.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help improve the page?</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
