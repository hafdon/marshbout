She might want to take him to town; Jean-Luc would love to visit a city in order to feel a soft pillow once again. What if we tell the rest of the party to make for the peak, and we'll be back as soon as we can. For now we're taking a skeleton crew to see if Fez can be saved. And Flick will confer with Startrella. &quot;Would it be possible to dial this starmote of yours to your specific location?&quot;</p> <h3 id="brand-destination"><a href="#brand-destination" class="header-anchor">#</a> Brand: Destination</h3> <ul><li>Startrella: I don't know if I can spontaneously teleport someone to me?</li> <li>Flick: Well I'd be one the one casting teleportation circle. So dialing in a permanent circle is one thing, but could I get to your location.</li> <li>Startrella: So like a moving destination โฆ I think I could set up something like that. I'd have to give you the sigils and the arrangement of the runestones and the starmotes, but we could rig something up.</li> <li>Flick: Write it on my forearm.</li></ul> <p>Startrella reaches out and burns the images into Flick's palm. &quot;I think it's kindof like a once-and-done thing, where we have to abandon it after the first use, since someone could come across it if they're trying to get in from the Nine Hells or the Astral Plane or something, but it should be good the first time we use it. We don't want to get [circle-bombed].&quot; &quot;Oh, like someone jacking in and drawing a dick onto your mule and then jacking out,&quot; asks Flick. &quot;Yeah, if the dick is like 400 million devils released onto your plane, exactly, yeah,&quot; says Startrella.</p> <h3 id="to-sandford"><a href="#to-sandford" class="header-anchor">#</a> To Sandford</h3> <p>So Flick, Fez, Jean-Luc, and Cyrowan head for <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/sandford.html">Sandford</a>, and the others for  <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/goblinsmite_peak.html">Goblinsmite Peak</a>. Flick, still feeling quite nauseated, makes sure to keep her distance from Fez. Flick doesn't have any reason to distrust Fez, but Cyrowan is all over him like a cheap suit, so is brooding and waiting for when Jean-Luc and she can be at least fifteen feet away.</p> <h3 id="ratfolk"><a href="#ratfolk" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ratfolk</h3> <p>Flick detects some rustling over near some scrub and bare trees. She sees two humanoids the size of Fez, with rodentlike faces. They have dark-brown hair, cute rounded ears and reddish-green eyes. (Fez is uniquely abled when it comes to shades of blue, which allow him to differentiate between areas of water. - Although lately within the last few days he's found himself less able to distinguish between shades of blue, ever since emerging from under the Xanthuc Temples. Fez assumes the sky has just changed; it's the same feeling you get when you come up from under decks.) Flick is sure that these are [ratfolk]. There are two of them looking towards the space where another must be. She starts to make a slow arc around the rest of the scrub.</p> <p>Jean-Luc, unalerted to the danger by Flick, who's just wandered around sneakily, continues to hang out. Fez continues to try to determine why his companions smell so bad, and tries to come up with the friendliest way to tell them (they probably already know). Cyrowan is always sticking his finger into himself and smelling it.</p> <ul><li>Cyrowan: Master Fez, there are quite a few herbs around here from which we could create a rub or poltice in order to mitigate some of the odor coming from you. I've been getting some complaints from Joan and her sensitive lizard nose.</li> <li>Fez: You've clearly mismanaged some of your pronouns there, but if you need to collect some herbs to mitigate the stink then you're welcome to.</li> <li>Cyrowan: Well thank you for your permission, sir. (And moves off into the clump of trees to the north).</li></ul> <p>Flick has circled around without seeing any more ratfolk. She makes a beeline over to Fez and Jean-Luc when Cyrowan disappears. &quot;I don't think your squire's entirely on the level.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Fez: Yes, he does have a bit of a limp. I assume it's some sort of problem for which he needs orthopedic inserts. Folk of his constitutional frailty often do.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: I mean this in the nicest possible way. You're not that great, and anyone that eager to serve has an agenda.</li> <li>Fez: Flick, are you going to take that?</li> <li>Flick: He's not wrong, Fez.</li> <li>Fez: Am I out of touch? No, it is my companions who are wrong. I don't think that he's eager to serve -- he's eager to <em>learn</em>. I may not be <em>the</em> greatest, but I am <em>a</em> greatest. I'm an A+ the greatest.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: your relative greatness is not the issue here. He doesn't smell great and I mean that in both senses of the word.</li> <li>Fez: I have noticed the smell, and I didn't want to bring this up, but I believe some of it may have rubbed off on you.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: well we were in a saddlebag together.</li> <li>Flick: Have you really not noticed, Fez, that since he's been along with us, the inner light that shines out and gives you your power has started dimming, almost like you've been forsaken or laid aside.</li> <li>Fez: But as the tide ebbs and flows, so do all things in life.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: just for a second, is it not possible that what we're saying has merit.</li> <li>Fez: Oh it's certainly possible, but I think it's less likely since we're not saying it.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: can we proceed for a moment as though we're right, and, if we aren't we'll happily eat crow.</li> <li>Fez: Everyone needs a time to shine, so I will let you explore your failures as a learning experience; so too my squire is learning to explore his own failures.</li> <li>Flick: that's great, we'll take it.</li></ul> <p><code>[Fez is, meta-speak, feeling under a single level of exhaustion. Pass Without Trace, shrouding them in a veil of silence, mutes the only conversational tone of the discussion. (Fez is at a &quot;everybody needs to hear this&quot; voice.)]</code></p> <h3 id="and-vengeance"><a href="#and-vengeance" class="header-anchor">#</a> โฆ and Vengeance</h3> <p>At this moment, Vengeance (daydreaming about being passed out drunk in <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/statos_den.html">Stato's Den</a>), shouting &quot;Wait for me!&quot;, walks sloppily up to them with Mule by his side. Simultaneously, Cyrowan, being held at knifepoint, is pushed out of the brush by a &quot;human&quot;. Flick whispers : &quot;this human doesn't know how little of a bargaining chip he has.&quot; Fez, &quot;Right on cue, a squire learning of failures.&quot; Jean-Luc, &quot;Certainly if he's a decent squire he can get himself out of that scrape.&quot;</p> <h3 id="cyrowan-captured-in-a-sacred-grove"><a href="#cyrowan-captured-in-a-sacred-grove" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cyrowan Captured in a Sacred Grove</h3> <ul><li><a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Jiffutch.html">Jiffutch</a>: Has your squire here been misplaced?</li> <li>Fez: Yes, he's been mis-placed, among many other misses</li> <li>Jiffutch: He was intruding upon sacred plants in our grove, and that will not be tolerated. We are protectors of this forest here.</li> <li>Fez: I'm quite sorry; were the plants clearly marked as sacred with appropriate signage?</li> <li>Jiffutch: From what realm do you hail that signage is required to recognize a sacred area?</li></ul> <p>All Flick can tell is that he's humanoid; he's dressed more like an adventurer: he has on leather armor, a tunic, leather gloves, and tight-fitting pants. He doesn't have any gear on him. &quot;Probably from some brigand's camp,&quot; thinks Flick.</p> <ul><li>Fez: No, most civilized areas <em>do</em> mark their sacred sites. Cities, Hobbittons, pretty much the whole thing is covered in signage.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: It does help in avoiding these kinds of misunderstandings.</li> <li>Vengeance: Did you say he was 'traipsing'? That doesn't really sound like him: he's not a traipser.</li> <li>Jiffutch: Yes, I was being generous there. He was mincing and squatting in very undecorous ways. Ugly is another way of putting the manner in which he was moving around the area.</li> <li>Cyrowan: Lord Fez, don't worry, I'll protect you from the sharp pointy end of this man's rapier.</li> <li>Fez: Yes, young squire, you're doing fantastic.</li> <li>Cyrowan: Luckily he's got it at the base of my spine. But I can see how for Lord Fez everything seems to be &quot;the neck&quot; insofar as it's above your eye-line.</li> <li>Fez: Well, druid? If you could please move your knife away from the behind of my squire, about a foot forward or so.</li> <li>Jiffutch: You claim responsibility for this wet musty man?</li> <li>Fez: In some ways, yes.</li> <li>Jiffutch: Note I didn't say 'lusty'. I hope you didn't mishear that.</li> <li>Fez: I diiiiid, and I'm quite confused.</li> <li>Jiffutch: I can't attest to his lustiness, only the way in which he smells of mildew, although, it doesn't appear to emanate from him, but one he has spent much time around.</li></ul> <p>Fez looks knowingly at Flick, and then Jean-Luc. &quot;This is what I was talking about before!&quot; &quot;This is what we get for not being in places with showers,&quot; replies Jean-Luc.</p> <ul><li>Fez: Anyway, he means you no harm. He was merely looking for plants to &quot;quench his stench&quot; as they say.</li></ul> <p>At that, Cyrowan attempts to make a break for Fez and slips on some wet grass, going face-first into the ground.</p> <ul><li>Fez: Thank you for prostrating yourself, as is required of a squire.</li> <li>Jiffutch: Truly I have no quarrel with him as a person, but he's invaded our sacred realm, and restitution must be made. [Prf-n.20] Your methods for commanding obeisance from your servants baffles me, but if this is how you do it, so be it.</li></ul> <p>Jiffutch takes a step back and prods Cyrowan forward with his sword. Flick adopts <em>bรบinn</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, &quot;Look you put me in a funny position because I'm kindof on Team Nobody here, but what I don't like is the idea of having to give you something just because you said these trees and shit belong to you. So how about our restitution is that you fuck right off and we go back to going about our business.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Jiffutch: Did you say, [Teem Nobodaddy]? One of the Great Gods of the Blay Kessons?</li> <li>Flick: Nope.</li> <li>Jiffutch: Well, you also told me to fuck off, and I will not do that, this is our Sacred Grove back here, and you should be the ones to fuck off.</li> <li>Jean-Luc: Uh - whoever does the fucking off, and either is fine with me, I think it's good if we go our separate ways.</li> <li>Jiffutch: If you're able to wrangle your rangy friend here โฆ</li></ul> <p>Flick turns back to Jean-Luc and Fez, &quot;Are we 100% sure we shouldn't just give him to them?&quot; Fez, &quot;Of course not. And please don't kill this poor man.&quot;</p> <p>Jiffutch: I have no desire to hang around this odorful young man.</p> <p>Jean-Luc (whispers): we <em>have</em> killed people for less offense.</p> <p><code>[Jean-Luc n.20]</code> Remembers Jiffutch from Cressida. There were a few posters; they never met in person. He's another assassin; one of them viewed themselves in competition. There were a certain number of rumors that circulated about him: he could change form, or hide in the sewers capably (could disappear into the sewers). He killed the <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/archduke_belsavius.html">Archduke Belsavius</a> when they were visiting Cressida; the Archduke holds their court in a different area of the country.</p> <p>Jiffutch is not stepping forward into the grove; he's either trying to avoid getting involved โฆ he probably doesn't want to pursue this any further than he has to. (The Pumpkin Prince is a persona that Jean-Luc had adopted to infiltrate royal courts; you heard it here first, folks). Jiffutch does not recognize Jean-Luc, who keeps the information to himself for the moment. &quot;It's in our mutual interest if we go our separate ways.&quot;</p> <p>Jiffutch: &quot;Yes, I think that's the best choice here. Even tho there's no signage&quot; and he throws a look at Fez, &quot;the grove is clearly adumbrated by the well-delineated difference between heavy forest and low grass. Make sure you ignore this weird little winding curve of the path close to myself, and be on your way!&quot;</p> <p>He attempts to blend into the forest, interrupted by Jean-Luc's question, &quot;We are quite a long way from Cressida. What brings you out here?&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;As I've said, I'm one of a group of forresting men who protect these trees from intruders. I -- we --- we're still attempting to grapple with the notions of pure democracy and communalism, so my pronouns may slip from time to time, but have no doubts that I have no connection with any urbanites.&quot;</p> <p>Jean-Luc, &quot;I think the Archduke would beg to differ.&quot;</p> <p>Jiffutch: &quot;The Archduke. bastard if I ever โฆ heard of a title. None of us need Archdukes, let alone masters, or lords, or vassals.&quot;</p> <p>Jean-Luc: &quot;No argument here. Why don't you drop the act, and tell us what you're doing out here.&quot; Flick goes to double the intimidation, but Jean-Luc gives her the &quot;tone it down&quot; sign. Immediately, his clothes shift and warble, and he grows in bulk to the point where his legs are little protrusions, and his body is a thick column of hairy muscle. His hands turn into claws and his face elongates. He's a ratman. a were-rat. &quot;You want me to drop the act, fine. But your charge gets it.&quot;</p> <p>Flick turns and looks south to where she saw the other ratfolk, and hears them rustling after Jiffutch calls out.</p> <p><code>[Initiative]</code></p> <p>Meanwhile Vengeance has been picking the sacred plants and creating a tiara for himself, crating it into a mitre and subconsciously emulating the wardrobe of the Archbishop which, for a monk, would typically be considered blasphemous.

Fez remembers tales of [4-dimensional beings] told to him while playing checkers, and wonders if this is what Vengeance is engaged in. Mule looks upset but reins it in and controls herself, but it seems like she's somewhat sensitive to the herbs chosen. Vengeance knows exactly what she's allergic to, which is seafood and carrots after conducting an allergy test with rusty bits of metal. Vengeance picks a few of the offending ones and puts them in his pack should Mule get out of hand later.</p> <h3 id="jiffutch-rages-out"><a href="#jiffutch-rages-out" class="header-anchor">#</a> Jiffutch rages out</h3> <p>Jiffutch attacks Cyrowan, biting him in the neck</p> <p>Flick: &quot;Gents, it does occur to me that Cyrowan might be necessary to undo what is afflicting Fez, it occurs to me the possibility that it's not his mere presence but a curse or geas<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.&quot; &quot;I don't like being ordered around by this asshole, so I'll save Cyrowan just to spite him,&quot; adds jean-Luc. &quot;I like it! and I'll take care of these fuckers in the bushes back here,&quot; says Flick.</p> <p>Cyrowan, unexpectedly hardy, is simultaneously bitten and stabbed. Little spouts of poison, coating the sword, overflow from Cyrowan's wounds. &quot;Master Fez, this feels like something Vengeance might do to himself while we're not watching. I think the faster you can get over here so I can learn from you, the better.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Fez: You seem to be learning quite well yourself but I will come aid you as requested.</li></ul> <p>Flick sends her &quot;extra-planar probe&quot; to sharpshoot one of the rustling shapes, sending a bolt of force damage into its mortal flesh and liquefying the organs, the pressure forcing the roiling contents explosively out of the ruptured skin.</p> <p>&quot;Cease! Cease!&quot; they hear from one of the surviving ratfolk. &quot;Stay where you are and it won't happen again,&quot; Flick says, slinking to an advantageous angle on Jiffutch's position. Still in a bloodlust, the musthrope<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> puts his foot on Cyrowan's neck, turns around to look at you, and sheaths his sword, shouting, &quot;Leave! Leave those folk alone. Do not implicate them in the horrific attacks you clearly wish to direct against me.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Didn't you start this?&quot; Fez asks. &quot;I did!&quot; he replies, &quot;but I had no idea how much power skulked within your wan and unmighty human bodies.&quot;</p> <ul><li>Fez: We're not human!--</li> <li>Flick: Fuck around and find out, buddy</li> <li>Jiffutch: Yes, the full truth of that ultimatum is becoming apparent to me. I truly have never before had to concern myself with a beleagured retinue of dispossessed who, in their time of need, name me leader. It truly is devastating, to witness the death of one's liegerat<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></li> <li>Flick: So will you take us up on that final offer?</li></ul> <p>Jiffutch helps Cyrowan to his feet: &quot;Here's your foul-smelling friend, although with my olfactory bulbs, I'm able to determine that the smell does not originate from him but rather the halfling here.&quot; He points clearly to Fez, who assumes him to be pointing at the third ratfolk.</p> <p>Fez rather pedantically and tiresomely inquires as to the ethical system which would allow one to attack those thought weaker than oneself, but the moment they are proven stronger, that person then desires peace. &quot;Kind of a shit-bird move, rat-man,&quot; Flick summarizes in her typical David Milchean way.</p> <p>&quot;It's not that you were weaker; my bloodlust got the best of me; and, as I've said, I'm not used to caring for those who can be shattered into pointilistic droplets of blood by the steady concentration of an archer. I truly โฆ do not know how to deal with this, psychologically, &quot; and he shrinks into his human form. The two rats in the grove continue weeping and looking towards one another in shock and disbelief.</p> <p>&quot;I kind of feel bad,&quot; Flick says. &quot;I don't!&quot; Jean-Luc responds.</p> <p>Now that Cyrowan has been helped to his feet, he moves to Fez. &quot;Sir, you were able to come to my aid so effectively. Allow me to once more pledge my undying servitude, and my desire to learn at your feet all the martial arts of swordplay and courtly graces and techniques of persuasion which ultimately woo to your side those who may wish to antagonize you but ultimately prove susceptible to your noble wits.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Your desire to serve is once again well-received, young one, and perhaps one day you will be as great as I am.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Apologies, sir, but I'm going to โฆ I think I left something back here.&quot; Cyrowan shuffles backwards out of the range of Fez's smell, motioning to Vengeance for some kind of sage smoke smudge or perfumy herb.</p> <p>&quot;We're going to have to speak about your regiment indeed,&quot; replies Fez. Vengeance walks over and wraps some of the sage around his neck and lights it up. &quot;Hieronymous, you truly are a kind companion. I don't know why you're persisting in this strange and unsolicited practice, but I will consent,&quot; says Cyrowan, breathing deeply of the smoke. Vengeance smells the fishy odor wafting from Fez.</p> <p>Flick comes over to inspect Cyrowan, but finds it incredibly difficult to concentrate on him long enough to conduct an inspection. The bite is severe, and already beginning to fester; but he has no idea if the musthropy is confounding the diagnosis. Leaning into her strengths, Flick wheels around to Jiffitch, &quot;Tell me what you did to him!&quot;</p> <p>Jiffutch approaches: &quot;I regret to tell you, your squire here has been infected with myranthropy. Vengeance, stomachic<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> he was guilted into using up some of your best smudgesage<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>, has his mind elsewhere, but Flick and Jean-Luc notice that Jiffutch is trying to catch their eye and avoid Cyrowan's.</p> <p>&quot;Why don't you and Cyrowan get going down the road, Fez,&quot; Flick says. &quot;An excellent idea; I have many things to teach him about an encounter, such as Never To Put One's Back To A Sword. Come, Cyrowan!&quot; says Fez.</p> <p>&quot;Master, you know it wasn't my fault! My back was to the sky while I was bent over collecting herbs. If I must treat the sky as a sword, then truly I don't know what to do, but these are lessons I must learn.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You must always be wary of <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/skyward_sword.html">skyward sword</a>; let me tell you of its greatness.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Please do, this is exactly what I came for!&quot; and he walks away with Fez, the latter pontificating incoherently on fighting stances.</p> <p>Fez and Cyrowan walk by the two rats near the grove cutting back the bits of shrub on which pieces of their exploded friends still rest. Fez hears one of them say something along the lines of &quot;Return to the mother&quot; or &quot;give to the mother&quot; and &quot;won't be a total waste&quot; but they nevertheless look emotionally devastated, and this clearly isn't any sort of opportunity for them. Fez remarks to Cyrowan, &quot;this is one of the problems with the primitive religions.&quot; To which Cyrowan responds, &quot;What makes them primitive for you, sir?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I think it's readily apparent โฆ they talk about worshipping. How do I say this? It's a matriarchal type of worship. Most religions have moved onto the more correct patritheism,&quot; says Fez.</p> <p>&quot;Very good, sir. What about a kind of non-binary theology?&quot; asks Cyrowan.</p> <p>&quot;That's a slightly more post-modern concept. I don't know if it'll ever catch on,&quot; replies Fez.</p> <p>&quot;What about serpent-sexual? Maybe even squid-sexual?&quot; asks Cyrowan.</p> <p>&quot;My knowledge of that is a little inky,&quot; puns Fez.</p> <p>Vengeance says, &quot;I'm sorry about your friend there. That was a real doozy. Did he have a wife and kids, that kind of thing?&quot;</p> <p><code>[1:27]</code> &quot;[Ripper] had a few friends, nobody in her domestic circle, sadly, but I know she will be missed,&quot; answers a rat introducing herself as [Catchkey].</p> <p>&quot;Probably a pillar of the community,&quot; says Vengeance.</p> <p>&quot;Well, as far as pillars, I know that Jiffutch has cautioned us from setting ourselves up on pedestals. In a way we're all supposed to be role models, but also followers,&quot; says Catchkey, believer in <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/ratical_democratic_ideals.html">Rat-ical Democ-Rat-ic ideals</a>.</p> <p>Flick, &quot;As usual, the people we exploded end up being pretty cool dudes.&quot;</p> <p>Catchkey, &quot;I'm only cool because my tears are helping to quench my hot rage, a rage I may not exact upon you, which, I'm told, is the best way. If only another here understood that emotions are better suppressed than acted upon, I wouldn't feel so alone.&quot;</p> <p>Febba, the more robust of the two, looks around, but no one meets her eyes.</p> <p>Flick comes up beside Jiffutch, &quot;what did you really want to say about Cyrowan.&quot;</p> <p>Jiffutch attempts a whisper. &quot;What do you know about this squire of yours? I've never seen a reaction to a bite, in a humanoid, quite like his.&quot;</p> <p>Flick, &quot;You don't need all the details, but he's super hinky. As a matter of fact, we're headed to Sandford <em>kind of</em> hoping to get him out of our hair? It's a work in progress. In fact, the only reason we didn't let you have your way with him is because it's possible we might need him to undo whatever fish curse has befallen our sacred warrior.&quot;</p> <p>Jean-Luc, &quot;And also I don't like you.&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;What's that there?&quot; Jean-Luc, &quot;nothing, we'll talk later.&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;Do I spy a fellow rogue?&quot; Jean-Luc, &quot;We've run in the same circles before.&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;Doubtless, I'm faster, as I can adopt a four-legged gait. Is this what you imply?&quot; Jean-Luc, &quot;Maybe, metaphorically we ran in the same circles. I was in Cressida when you assassinated the Archduke. Beat me to it, as it were.&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;Then I must appear as no less than an idol to you. Speaking of stepping on pedestals; I know I tell the smaller folk that it's something we can leave behind, but I'm glad it keeps those like us on our toes, am I right?&quot; Jean-Luc, &quot;Sure -- back to our problem with our squire 'friend'&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;Yes, now that I have revealed myself as a shapechanger, particularly of the rodentia, I can admit I spend a great deal of time in the sewers, I've met my share of huge โฆ turtles of a juvenile age, which have mutated into large crime-fighting forms, Turtle Power, but what I wish to impart to you is that your once-paladin's squire is under the rule of some kind of icky, underwater deity. There's a feeling of โฆ I don't know if you could tell,&quot; looking at Flick, &quot;but the wound exhibited almost a protective sludge that it exuded, against my bite, and very few know the bite of a lycanthrope or muranthrope takes effect, but I was able to see that it would not, and it's perhaps because this creature is not suceptible to that sort of magic.&quot; Flick, &quot;Are you implying that he's not even humanoid? Or that he's just been -- or that he's in thrall to some kind of pescid deity?&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;I think it's affected his physical makeup, if ever he was fully humanoid: it could be that that's merely an adopted hybrid form.&quot; Flick, &quot;This is in alignment with our gathering suspicions. So he's not actually going to turn into a were-rat, is he?&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;I don't believe so, no. But given the power of his pledge, he may acquire some of the more pernicious features, but I don't believe that fully inhabiting the body of a giant rat will ever be available to him, no.&quot; Flick, &quot;One more reason to put him down, amirite, J-L?&quot; Jean-Luc, &quot;As if we needed one.&quot; Flick, &quot;Well, not being aware of your history together, I can't help but think this meeting is slightly awkward; thanks for the help you've given us โฆ&quot; Jiffutch, &quot;I myself am against capital punishment, so please take that into consideration when dealing with this creature.&quot; Jean-Luc: &quot;I would prefer to take my morality lessons from literally anybody else.&quot; Jiffutch: &quot;Yes, we should make up our own minds while keeping in front of us the precepts and morals which have been passed down by those who make it their profession to outline the tenants of such beliefs.&quot; Jiffutch: &quot;Catch you on the flipside --&quot;</p> <p>Flick: &quot;--------------------------------Dudemeisters!&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance: &quot;bee tee dubs, have you ever been to a place called Redwall, in Mossflower?&quot;</p> <p>Jiffutch begins to daydream and pontificate, &quot;Oh the beautiful red โฆ stoneโฆ walls of Redwall, in their โฆ carved โฆ stone โฆ shapes!&quot; as he retreats back into the grove. Vengeance can tell he has no idea what he's talking about.</p> <p>Catchkey and the other have placed the straw into bundles and move to catch up with Jiffutch.</p> <p>Jean-Luc, &quot;There were always rumors that Jiffutch used the sewers to move so quickly about the city, but I have no idea what he's doing here.&quot; Jean-Luc has no idea if this is an act or part of a job, if he's ingratiating himself to the rat people as part of a job, or if he really did find some sort of inner peace. It's probably not the inner peace one, though. I have to believe that, whatever nefarious plans he may have, they do not involve us.</p> <p>Flick, &quot;The fact that a court assassin from Cressida is in this neck of the woods tells us that whatever settlement we show up at is going to be kindof a shit show.&quot; Jean-Luc, &quot;Yes, it usually is.&quot;</p> <p>Flick, &quot;It was weird how quickly they panicked, too, but that might have been a sincere reaction.&quot; Fez, even at his distance, smells a rat. &quot;It is concerning that he seemed to care about it,&quot; says Jean-Luc. &quot;He obviously needs them for some reason,&quot; suggests Fez. &quot;If you want to be cynical about it, he clearly felt he couldn't lose any more of them.&quot; says Flick. &quot;Or,&quot; says Jean-Luc,&quot; he was using it to disguise his own self-preservation.&quot;</p> <h3 id="burrowlings"><a href="#burrowlings" class="header-anchor">#</a> Burrowlings</h3> <p>The group proceeds south-east a couple miles, only to hear a high-pitched whining cry, sounded pained and distressed, coming from off to the right. A humanoid animal. Flick, &quot;God, no more werecreatures!&quot; &quot;A little too high-pitched to be just an animal&quot; says Jean-Luc, &quot;I've never claimed to be the most moral person, but i don't want innocent things to suffer horribly.&quot; Jean-Luc draws his sword in case it's a trap. They see a creature about 70 feet away, in deep brush and lake weeds. The small creature is light brown and furred; it reminds them of a large prairie-dog. It looks like it would walk on two legs. It's wearing a bicep bracelet and a little satchel. It is bent over double and appears to be weeping.</p> <p>Flick starts traipsing through the brush and calls out &quot;oh fellow traveller, we mean you no harm,&quot;</p> <p>Nem, &quot;Who's there, who's talking? What do you want?&quot; Flick, &quot;Only to see what troubles you.&quot; Jean-Luc, &quot;We heard your cries from the road.&quot;</p> <p>This creature's eyes were clouded with tears, and when she looked up she couldn't see anything, &quot;I don't know if you can helpโฆ&quot;</p> <p>Flick, closing the distance, can see that there is a body in front of this creature, over which they are bowed. The cause of death cannot be determined. There is no blood, and they appear to be wearing as few clothes as the other.</p> <p>Vengeance recognizes these creatures from around the monastery. They were notorious for undermining the foundations by digging extensive tunnels. He even recognizes this sort of cry; if one of the burrowlings would become isolated from the rest of the pack and be unable to find its way back. The call could attract the pack, who would rescue them.</p> <p>Vengeance, &quot;Oh my god, guys, I hate these fucking things. You don't know how many of them I had to hit over the head; the problem is, you hit one, and another just pops up in their place. They're disgusting. I hate them.&quot;</p> <p>Fez, &quot;That reminds me of a childhood game we used to play, whack-a-gnoll.&quot;</p> <p>Flick, &quot;Ironically, since gnolls are not burrowing creatures.&quot;</p> <p>Fez, &quot;Yeah, it was real messed up and racist&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance, &quot;It sounds like you were assassinating them.&quot;</p> <p>Fez, &quot;I'm not proud of it, ok. It was a different time, then.&quot;</p> <p>As Vengeance and Fez recount the ways in which they would kill humanoids, &quot;I can't find the rest of our burrow; I can't drag my friend back there and also find my way. Perhaps you can help?&quot; says the burrowling.</p> <p>Flick and Jean-Luc's knowledge of the creatures is simlar to Vengeance's. Since they aren't as tied to the preservation of large stone buildings, they don't care if the ground has holes. Perhaps Jean-Luc knows of some who were taken in by the ratfolk in the cities almost like orphans or refugees, and used as scouts. They feel comfortable under the ground or living in the interstitial parts of houses. For the most part though you would know them as farmers who brought goods into the city to sell, or, for Flick, as farmers. Flick's parents would complain about burrowlings whose holes would cause the occasional broken ankle for a farmhand, but wouldn't pose a danger to the crops.</p> <p>Flick, &quot;First of all, I'm sorry for your loss, no one deserves to go through that. How did your companion meet their sad fate?&quot;</p> <p>Nem: &quot;We were just at the water to refresh ourselves, and it'd been a long journey here, but then she was grabbed by some kind of creature, and all I could do was bring her back out, and I couldn't resuscitate her.&quot;</p> <p>Flick moves away from the bank, and activates her Primeval Awareness for Monstrosities and Fiends (her favored enemies). Flick doesn't detect either of those within (5) miles.</p> <p><code>[Which may not be entirely accurate at the greater limits โฆ]</code></p> <p>Vengeance, &quot;What did this creature look like?&quot;</p> <p>Nem: &quot;It was mostly under water; it didn't really poke its head out. It was a blue, humanoid, seemed โฆ&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance, &quot;I think that your friend was a little clumsy and drowned herself. Should we be on our way?&quot;</p> <p>Jean-Luc, &quot;Ignore him. We're sorry for your loss. He's not used to life outside the monastery.&quot;</p> <p>Nem: &quot;Oh, he lives in a monastery? I guess I can relate to that โฆ the burrow at times can feel kind of constraining.&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance, &quot;No. I never felt constrained&quot;</p> <p>Nem: What was your experience there like?</p> <p>Vengeance: Whatever it was, it was completely the opposite of yours, ok. WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE FRIENDS. Let me just nip this in the bud.</p> <p>Nem: We certainly have far different levels of hair coverage over our bodies.</p> <p>Vengeance: You haven't even complimented my hat.</p> <p>Nem: Oh, is that a hat? I thought it was a strange growth.</p> <p>Vengeance: Oh, that's a benign cyst.</p> <p>Nem: Which side is the hat on?</p> <p>Vengeance: It's cocked โฆ rakishly โฆ to the right? Am I still talking to you?</p> <p>Nem: Yes. do you wish to?</p> <p>Vengeance: No, I'm done here. Why are we talking to this beast. Does anybody care about this?</p> <p>Flick: It's no beast, Vengeance. We're rendering the same aid we would expect from any other honest traveller on the road.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: And let's be honest, we do our share of harm in the world; this feels only right that we try to put some aid out as well.</p> <p>Flick: If you're not wearing a tiara you have nothing to fear from us.</p> <p>Vengeance: Well I'm not the one who exploded somebody with an arrow; my record is clean and I don't need to do any sort of penance here. You can do your good deeds, and I'm gonna be on my way.</p> <p>Flick: He's not wrong.</p> <p>Nem: It's so good to know that a community of adventurers still wears its heart on its sleeve. That everything it feels is easily โฆ descried. I might even say โฆ it's perfect โฆ for this โฆ moment.</p> <p>Flick draws her bow. She suddenly grows goosepimples and for the first time experiences horripilation, and goes to retreat about thirty more feet until she recognizes an eerie feeling fetting<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> from that direction.</p> <p>Jean-Luc sees the burrowling that was dead leaps up, Alive! &quot;The Samaritan Snare is what we call it in the trade.&quot; Flick turns, and for a moment experiences an alternate timeline of her life in which she fell into madness upon hearing otherworldly slurps and whispers from the back room of a tavern. This creature is a grotesque, spaghettilike, blue fleshcone, inset with hundreds of piercing red eyes, on top of pink fleshy spider legs -- the Lovecraftian version of the Lunar Lander.</p> <p>Fez, &quot;Is it called Putreosity or something.&quot;</p> <p>Gorf: the name is SOULEATER or GORF as I'm known by my friends.</p> <p>Fez, &quot;I guess you'll be Souleater to us, then.&quot;</p> <p><code>[The DM would like to indicate that yes, he is friends with Gorf.]</code></p> <blockquote><p>The real monstrosity was the friends we made along the way!</p></blockquote> <p>Gorf blasts Flick with a black beam of crackling energy shooting from one of its eyes. &quot;You've let me see your soul, and I will have it!&quot;</p> <p>Flick, &quot;Not today, flesh rover.&quot;</p> <p>Jean-Luc, &quot;Just another weird monster that wants souls!&quot; The burrowling ([Nem] he'd just spoken to smiles confidently and runs towards Jean-Luc. It bits into Jean-Luc's leg, but he manages to rattle its noggin with a good kick such that it can't get its claws into him.</p> <p>&quot;Submit to Gorf and this will all be over!&quot; screams Nem.</p> <p>Jean-Luc, &quot;I've been โฆ I have better offers on the table.&quot;</p> <p>Nem, &quot;But this offer is so close and convenient. -- so be it. &quot;</p> <p>Vengeance jumps towards the burrowlings and fiddles with some oil and a flint to cast fireball. Jean-Luc slashes at Nem, but the agile creature manages to make out with a mere scratch.</p> <p>Nem: You see, the natural weapons are far stronger than those made by corrupted man!</p> <p>Jean-Luc sees, coming out of the water, his long-lost love, Lydia, with whom he had such a terrible / uneventful breakup. Flick sees an unfamiliar woman. Jean-Luc regains 6 HP, feeling energized and replenished. 'Lydia' says to Jean-Luc, &quot;I have been โฆ hiding from these evil creatures in here. I tried to drown one. If you can come over and help me out of the waters, that I know that we can defeat them together and return to the city.&quot; Part of Jean-Luc knows that there is 0 chance that the woman he met in Cressida, the daughter of a shopkeeper, has found herself in this body of water drowning a burrowling; versus a familiar face and an offer to go back to the city.</p> <p>Flick: 100% this is a Rusalka, guys!</p> <p>Fez: Could also be a changeling.</p> <p>Jean-Luc is vaguely suspicious. As far as he can tell, it's Lydia: he can smell a perfume of hers, the alto of her voice is spot on; the grass is parting as she moves through the grass towards him. She throws scared and frightened looks at the burrowlings. Despite his vague suspicions, he says, &quot;Let's defeat them together.&quot;</p> <p>Lydia, &quot;It's so wonderful we can be together again!&quot;</p> <p>Jean-Luc, &quot;Indeed; I've always regretted our breakup&quot;</p> <p>Lydia, &quot;Me too, why, can you even remind me of why -- no, nevermind, all we need is this moment right now, and our shared future.&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance takes a book of matches in one hand, and oil in the other, caught in an endless process where either the matches or the oil is not in the right place at the right time. Mule has come over to lick up the applebutter oil which is what Vengeance has been using. (She's allergic to apple skins, but not applebutter made without the skins.)</p> <p>Cyrowan, &quot;Master Vengeance, do you need assistance lightning the oil?&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance, &quot;Yeah -- if you could just light that match , that'd be terrific.&quot;</p> <p>Cyrowan, &quot;Sometimes the hardest thing to do is a thing you've done by yourself thousands of times.&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance, &quot;Yes, I find that's always the case,&quot; and he casts fireball at Gorf. &quot;As a terrible person I love Ska music, but I've never been a fan of real big fish.&quot;</p> <p>Nem: Who are you talking about?</p> <p>Gorf gets burnt up. Some of the blue ooze comprising its upper pyramid starts to smolder, and Gorf begins to give off a pestilent aura possibly more pestilent than Fez's. The odor smells like burning play-doh. Gorf, skittering on its spider appendages, is only as fast as your typical adventurer.</p> <p>Vengeance, &quot;Anyone up for a fish fry?&quot;</p> <p>Cyrowan, &quot;Very good, master vengeance.&quot;</p> <p>Flick, resentful towards Fliph for the embarrassing attempt at stealing the former's name without the proper mouth anatomy (&quot;weird malformed burrowling tongue&quot;), and even more resentful that she didn't get &quot;advantage&quot; against the heavily obscured ratfolk, with Fliph not having acted, she is flatfooted.</p> <p>K'Fliph: Actually my name is K-Fliph; I just prefer not to pronounce it because I'm so good at it.</p> <p>Flick moves far to the east, at the north rim of the lake, -- &quot;are you a rapper?&quot;</p> <p>My signature move is to K'Fliph you off.</p> <p>Flick sees, as the force damage from her arrow concusses K'fliph, that her skin almost gives way to an cadaverous explosion of blood, but her tough burrowling skin retains her body's flesh, and she barely surives the blast.</p> <p>I think now I'm just &quot;phhhhhhhhhhhh&quot;</p> <p>Flick, &quot;There are still bigger fish to fry.&quot; Fliph, &quot;Bigger FLIPH to fry?&quot;</p> <p>Flick shoots a Fizzlecyst poison arrow at Gorf, missing. She then slides her shield off her shoulder and holds it in front, but she'll have to drop it to fire her bow. Confronted with the enormity of Gorf's aberrational body; Flick finds herself unable to focus on Gorf, caught in a look unable to focus. <code>[Wisdom save 10]</code>. She's drawn to the moment in her past? future? where she encountered a similar type of creature, and for the moment feels herself compelled to indulge in a tic. Flick had trouble with biting her fingernails, which made drawing a bow so painful, so she'd given it up.</p> <p>[K'Fliph], at the brink of death, decides to attack Flick. Flick keeps her clawing hands at bay with her shield, but KP bites into her legs. &quot;Looks like once I get under your shield I can begin tearing at your flesh.&quot;</p> <p>Cyrowan: Master, who do you wish that I should go after? Fez: Do your best to be a distraction on behalf of Jean-Luc. His fighting style is sadly inadequate while alone; if you were to interpose yourself perhaps he could attain &quot;average&quot; effectiveness. The closer Cyrowan gets to Gorf, his body begins to ripple and turn black, almost like he's experiencing spontaneous idiopathic bruising. As this happens, he concentrates on Gorph, and the ground around Gorph explodes in tentacles in a 20ft. square.</p> <p>Gorph, perhaps a kindred spirit to these tentacles, rides them like a wave, as its spiderlegs massage the tentacles. &quot;You think one of the Old Spells can damage me? You're incredibly mistaken.&quot;</p> <p>Cyrowan's arms and feet are plunged into the earth, and look to be rising again as the tentacles. Fez, seeing this, sees the otherwordly evil emanating from every being, and sees Mule as the closest target. Mule looks at Fez, assumes the best, and comes closer and begins to nuzzle Fez. &quot;Roxfalannnah noooooooo!&quot; screams Vengeance. Fez goes &quot;whole hog&quot; at the eldritch horror. &quot;Fiend!&quot; he shouts, showing off to Cyrowan, going for a sweep the leg / tentacles.</p> <p>Vengeance sees Fez clearly taunting him, skipping around Mule and slashing at her fetlocks with his whip. &quot;Ah, that's actually pretty hot&quot; declares Vengeance.</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div> <hr class="footnotes-sep"> <section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>A particular ready position learned by elven rangers. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">โฉ๏ธ</a></p></li> <li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>(pr. gesh, gaysh, geesh)  <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">โฉ๏ธ</a></p></li> <li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>Also muranthropy or myranthropy; were-mouse or were-rat-dom. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">โฉ๏ธ</a></p></li> <li id="fn4" class="footnote-item"><p>Like a liegeman, but a ratfolk. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">โฉ๏ธ</a></p></li> <li id="fn5" class="footnote-item"><p>fig.
