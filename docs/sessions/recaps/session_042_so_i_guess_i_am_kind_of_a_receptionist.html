Vengeance considers continuing to heal Cyrowan.</p> <p>Flick wonders what she knows about Elementals. Their intelligence is generally at the level of most beasts, but since Flick can't communicate with elementals as she can with beasts, spoken-language communication is out of the question. On the plane of water, they are animated energy. They can take shape and perform tasks when someone calls them into being on the material plane. The only ones she's ever heard of were bound into service by a powerful mage; they generally resent being bound into service, somewhat like geniis. Flick attempts to communicate with [Anghala]; it hovers where it is, turning the flat of its front towards Flick. The elf's primeval awareness is of no use here; she can't detect its emotions. &quot;It is a slightly too anti-entropic disturbance in the water&quot; Flick ruminates aloud. <code>[DM describes it as a particle in quantum field theory.]</code> It has a head-mound and pseudopod-like extensions.</p> <p>The only other elementals Flick has encountered … she wonders why it's here. Could the impact have … ? She wonders if some kind of arcane disjunction is the reason for the explosion, and Anghala is the result. Maybe someone in Sandford will know something.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: Are we sure this was caused by an impact, and not a portal-gone-wrong, or something like that?</p> <p>[&quot;Flick only has exterior monologues.&quot;]</p> <p>Flick detects faintly a portal inchoate in her bag. As Flick touches the rope of climbing, she feels like there's some sort of portal energy about it. There's a little of the portal around Gorph's dead body, and a lot around Cyrowan.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: We have a number of other pressing issues which may take precedence over The Mystery at Planghage Lake.</p> <p>The group takes a short rest. Flick examines [the bracers on the burrowlings arms]; where they are it's preserved a thin margin of living tissue. She wraps the bracer in oilskins. Vengeance: Is there any way we can make some armor out of this stuff?</p> <p>Flick: If whatever created the lake is what gave this is duermer, it might point the way to what is happening. It wasn't just a meteor. It wouldn't create such a precise --- it wouldn't create that small of an impact. They'll know something at Sandford. Flick doesn't remember any astronomical phenomena from a year ago.</p> <p>Because this would have been such soft ground at the time, being in the course of a river, the impact site might be larger than expected if a meteor had contacted bedrock or a hard substrate.</p> <p>Vengeance collects some &quot;rings&quot; before they go to use as sexy two-finger rings one might see in a brothel.</p> <p><code>[SHORT REST]</code></p> <p>They should be able to make it to Sandford before twilight. Flick and Jean-Luc see that in the burrowling satchels it's filled up with gems and minerals. Nature check tells Jean-Luc that some of these have been passed off as fools gold, and some look genuine. THey don't look to have been collected with thyme or reason. Jean-Luc takes one of the satchels.</p> <p>Vengeance: &quot;We're rich!&quot; Vengeance has de-articulated the bones of the one Gerd brought up and is displaying the bones as if they are treasures. That skeleton also had a bracer so they each have one now.</p> <h3 id="walking-towards-sandford"><a href="#walking-towards-sandford" class="header-anchor">#</a> Walking towards Sandford.</h3> <p>as they approach from the west, they can see the remnants of full walls, which are now just isolated guardposts. the road thy're on now leads down the center of the town towards the market square. there are a few neighborhoods, but the main roads run to the ports; there is a port up at the top called <a href="/marshbout/locations/melliansein.html">Melliansein</a>. The main entrance is in the southeast. An area called <a href="/marshbout/locations/gentles_beach.html">Gentle's Beach</a> -- it lends itself towards brittleness, but it can be made into excellent weapons. they can put an obsidian edge on the weapons which make them incredibly sharp. but do they break more freqnently than other weapons? seems to contradict saying they are strong.</p> <p>vengeance knows that sandford, now in early fall, holds a famous fishing competition around this time of year. they have very good fishing all year round. we're getting into virginia-style temperate weather. marlin, flounder, red-fish, bass, and tuna. competitions are held around now to see how can get the most and largest fish.</p> <p>jean-luc has heard of a group called the <a href="/marshbout/factions/hat_baskets.html">Hat Baskets</a> (&quot;weird naming convention&quot;); he can't quite recall the thieves can't for the name. they operate here in Sandford; they direct a lot of their attention eastward, because they are the first port west of the steeplepeak mountains, so if someone rounds the peak, they will land in Sandford first. the first place north that you can cross is at least 100 miles north at <a href="/marshbout/locations/rockbreaker_pass.html">Rockbreaker Pass</a>, where there is an outpost of <a href="/marshbout/factions/frost_orcs.html">Frost Orcs</a> . they aren't evil orcs, but they aren't known to be comradely -- one might say they're chilly or frigid to strangers. you would have to go ever further north to find a proper welcoming trading town.</p> <p>The town essentialy follows : hardscrabble properties on the outside, more elite / bourgeoise properties as you go further in, there's a lot of industry around the ports ; but it's a smallish town.</p> <p>Looking for some healing</p> <p>they are looking for temple or medicamentum at which to drop Fez.</p> <p>Vengeancae: fellows, please avoid the fishing competition or it will bring up some pretty bad memories for me. But I <em>would</em> like to see the famous sandflats.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: Do you think we're on a sightseeing trip?</p> <p>Vengeance: I'm just saying that if we happen to pass by, like they are kindof world famous, and it would be weird to go on with our lives and be like yeah we went to sandford but no we didn't see the sandflats.</p> <p>Flick: i'm not as interested as vengeance is, but it's a very different landscape from where I group up, and I have an inherent interest in ecological diversity.</p> <p>Jean-Luc: I'm just happy we're in a place with buildings. (He takes a deep breath of city air, looking around, and lets out a contended sigh) &quot;it sure beats hiding in a forest and going through underground caves with monsters trying to eat me&quot;</p> <p>JL detects on the air the faint smell of salty brine, different from that of Fez (the wind blowing strongly up from the southeast), brackish waters. It leads him to believe … the southern arm of the pony mountans come down and funnel the sea air past Sandford and <a href="/marshbout/locations/follicle_bay.html">Follicle Bay</a>, where things get &quot;a little hairy&quot;.</p> <p>Flick suggests heading to the plaza.</p> <p>The only city Flick has experience with is Cressida. and the brief stay in marshbout, so she doesn't have a good comparative grasp of levels of civilization. this town strikes her fairly provincial understanding . Cressida is like &quot;athens in its heyday in terms of the qquality of its buildings&quot;. it lounges along the shores of the lake for 11 miles. &quot;A lot of people say they're from cressida when they're actually from <a href="/marshbout/locations/north_breszleton.html">North Breszleton</a>.&quot;</p> <p>Flick's parents (adoptive parents) have a nice house in the actual city -- but she was mostly raised on their farmholding to the northwest. Flick just grew up on the dacha and could never go to Moscow. she wasn't a point of pride ot that family, (though wasn't a shameful secret either). she was never part of that part of their lives. treated like the landscaper at times?</p> <p>sandford is -- the buildings don't stand out in terms of height,, at most 3-story buildings, except for religious buildings. a lot of lazy watertraffic, people fishing in the bay, some pleasure boating perhaps. for the most part it's incredibly approachable. the indutries are relegated to the outskirts. glass is a notoriously smelly business, and since the wind blows to the NW they try to keep those industries on the NW edge, and also nearer the sands. mostly sleepy houses with a shore-feeling town.</p> <p>the market square is large for the town, and quite a few smaller ones are spread out as they approach the center. people ahve gardens around their plots, and a number of lackadaisical farms dotted the outlands. it's almost a party port stop, or vacation port stop, in part, for people rounding the peak. but it's not a &quot;resort town&quot; . there's a divide - the north are the cheaper houses, and to the right near gentle's beach might be more expensive houses with absentee landlord holdings.</p> <p>[The walls] look like they're been maintained for academic or archaeological reasons. some of them have been rebuilt in a cast? of the original walls. there are ancient inscriptions on them. where they end, at pillars, is a discrete ending; they are cut off succinctly. they aren't allowed to continue to crumble. sort of like sections of the great wall where tourists are allowed.</p> <p>flick: so it's part of a historical artefact. and it looks like the town might even take pride maintaining it. there is a tower far to the south, and up north, and the towers look like there is activity around them and being maintained. and they have nominal sections of wall connected to them.</p> <p>Flick, as they're walking down the main road, looks for &quot;places of godly healing&quot;. (should have made this investigation). See some churchlike structures, none in particular dedicated to gods of healing that she can see.</p> <p><a href="/marshbout/locations/temple_of_kashtari.html">Temple of Kashtari</a> - few adornments on the outside, looks like a small ziggurat, carved out of sandstone. there's one large door that opens into darkness . no symbols of a god that they can see. (terraced compound of successively receding stories or levels) - there's a symbol of a double helix, horizontal, like an infinity sign with tails.<br>
(in historical ziggurats, the face bricks ('facings') were glazed or painted; astrological signs sometimes; kings names)</p> <ul><li>usually a staircase/ramp leading up, or around like a spiral</li></ul> <p>Vengeance: looks like my kind of place.</p> <p>Jean-Luc looks for thieve's cant symbols. The temple itself is completely devoid of any markings; they might get rubbed off or ground off (escept for the helix) . there's a post , a stone post with an iron rings, closer to the road. there's a <a href="">symbol that means &quot;high risk high reward&quot;</a>, maybe <code>(jean-luc only rolled a 9)</code></p> <p>jean-luc glosses as &quot;enter at your own risk&quot;. flick: what does that mean to you. JL: it means that these people probably aren't to be trifled with, but are probably holding some form of power and or riches, or else it would just be &quot;stay away&quot; . given that we're not looking to swindle them, surely there's no harm in talking to them.</p> <p>Flick: ok, let's go in.</p> <p>They get up to the door and are still not greeted by anyone. as they go to enter through the darkness their path is impeded by an invisible wall or field of force.</p> <p>Flick: &quot;Hello, if you have the services to offer that I think, we have someone in need of them&quot;</p> <p>From the step above there is now visible a guard. they are wearing shiny, burnished, somewhat expensive-looking armor. there's a helmet, breastplate, and leg plates, and they are carrying a spear. <code>[JL critical fail on investigation]</code> tells him it's highest quality function and form. Sure it's made out of Sandford brass.</p> <p>JL makes it a point to keep his hand as far away from his sword. Guard takes a look at you and points her spear at the group.</p> <p>&quot;Whose authority are you here on?&quot;</p> <p>JL considers pulling out the &quot;badge of tepplin&quot; but decides against it. &quot;We;re not here on anyone's authority. our friend needs help and we thought you might be able to help&quot;</p> <p>&quot;who is your friend and what do they need help with&quot;</p> <p>Fez is walking in a half-daze behind them, being doted on by Cyrowan.</p> <p>That one there, the bedraggled and smelly one? We're seeing this all the time .go around back; they'll know what to do with you.</p> <p>&quot;AROUND BACK!&quot; &quot;LIKE A SERVANTS ENTRANCE&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance: could you tell me what this material is made of? I could really use some of it for my miming? mining? routine.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not a geologist who's here to answer your questions, but it should be obvious to anyone that it's the famous [Sandstone] available only in Sandford.&quot;</p> <p>JL: I think he's referring to the force-field …</p> <p>Guard: Oh, the door? I'm not going to reveal the secrets of this sacred institution.</p> <p>Flick: I hope the bedside manner is a little more polished than the reception area.</p> <p>Guard: What's that?!</p> <p>Flick (repeats herself)</p> <p>Guard: I'm not paid to be a receptionist, I'm paid to keep rabble out of the front here.</p> <p>JL: and a fine job you're doing of it too.</p> <p>Some rocks and sand cascade down around them as they walk cautiously towards the back.</p> <p>JL: as obnoxious as they are, i don't think we want to trifle with them.</p> <p>Vengeance: Who gets to enter through the front?</p> <p>Guard: Only those authorized to do so . if you know how to get in, then that means you're authorized. I guess, you know what, I am here as a bit of a receptionist. There's not much people can do if they can't get in. But look the only thing polished about my manner is my armor, and that's the way I'd like to keep it.</p> <p>Vengeance: so you're basically just here to tell people to go around back.</p> <p>Guard: I'm not out here all the time. i only came out here because I saw confused visitors come up to the front, and it was clear you didn't know how to get through the door.</p> <p>vengeance: so what is your usual job?</p> <p>guard: that's another one of the ineffable secrets of the temple!</p> <p>vengeanec: well perhaps we shall learn it soon</p> <p>guard: only if you are qualified as determined by the most esoteric of the practitioners</p> <p>2nd guard: &quot;woooooooooooooooooo&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: now i'm spooked; ok guys let's do what they said</p> <p>(guards hi-five in the distance)</p> <p>the temple is pretty large, the size of a block, which means like 150 ft square. it goes up almost as high. they come around the back, towards the back the temple extends as 12-foot high walls, and there's a tiny opening in the walls into a back courtyard. as they look into the courtyard, there are dozens of cots and bedrolls laid out, and on almost all of them are humanoids in various stages of decomposition, but still alive. the stench is a wall of marsh and decaying flesh.</p> <p>vengeance: it looks like he'd be ok here. why don't we just dump him and be on our way.</p> <p>JL: i'm not against that on principle, but we should probably talk to someone first.</p> <p>Making their way amongst the cots and bedding are people carrying fresh bedding, cloths, pitchers of water, bandages, and medicine, and applying them as need be. they are setting up tents and coverings. there's even the beginning of the construction of a pavilion top to the rear portico.</p> <p>Flick: these are humans that are kind of making do with what they have, rather than druids/elves who would know better, or clerics that can invoke religion power.</p> <p>vengeance and JL: the outfits the caretakers are wearing covers their bottom halves entirely and looks almost more like a bustle or billow floor-length skirt. all the people delivering the care are of a type. it looks like they've been swimming in chlorinated pools. there is some treatment that the bourgoisie use for their personal swimming coves, athat makes your hair look a little green, and these people all have that creenish tinge to their hair; they are immaculately tanned, and none of them are wearing tops, they just have chiselled muscles, perfectly adonis-like bodies, both men and women.</p> <p>Vengenace goes to lift a bustle. <code>[sleight of hand]</code>. his hand passes right through the cloth , and they keep on walking like nothing has happened. on scrutiny, the people evince a smoother, almost wavelike motion, bobbing from back to front or up and down.</p> <p>JL wonders if these are servants, or mind control, or constructs of a magician. how much feels malevolent? <code>[criticall fails]</code> -- JL is sure that it's either mind control or servant constructs. doesn't know why there would be a fabric component.</p> <p>as he's thinking this, another one comes past and lick their lips a bit, or flick their tongue out. &quot;Oh, do you have another one?&quot;</p> <p>flick: another what?</p> <p>nurse 1: the … <a href="/marshbout/diseases/seigmerrin.html">seigmerrin</a>. the marsh-sick.</p> <p>flick: he does smell like a marsh.</p> <p>nurse 1: bring him over here. (she motions to a cot)</p> <p>flick: we're gonna be close by, fez</p> <p>vengeance (whispers) i think it was a good sign she licked her lips like that. we can probably entrust fez to their healing and leave him here.</p> <p>JL :these people are clearly being controlled by something ; the question is whether or not it's of their own volition. <code>[perception]</code> as he's looking around paranoiacally - sees on the 3rd level, above the one the guards were on, actually windows of a sort; they are round, and JL sees a face which appears briefly, looks down, and quickly hides behind the wall.</p> <p>JL communicates this to his companions. they agree not to leave Fez's side for the moment.</p> <p>Nurse1 leads fez to the cot and lay him back. another nurse:</p> <p>hello my name is <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Odeshka.html">Odeshka</a>. may I examine your friend here.</p> <p>flick: yes please</p> <p>odeshka: do you know his symptoms? what has he been experiencing. i can detect the smell, but the other signs are absent. there doesn't appear to be decomp or salt crystals forming on open wounds.</p> <p>flick: he's been this way only a day or so. he used to have a holy presence to him; he projected an aura of safety or security. ever since we --- it's gradually been replaced with this nauseating fish odor. it could be that he was supernatural to begin with, but he's not getting better</p> <p>vengeance: he also doesn't have <a href="/marshbout/factions/choam.html">insurance</a></p> <p>as Odeshka stepped closer, she didn't appear to be affected by fez's smell.</p> <p>Flick is the only one (with a 10+) with her heightened elven smelling that the smell of the courtyard was qualitatively different from fez's smell, which was nauseating in a kind of otherworldly way.</p> <p>even given that, Odeshka puts a cloth up to her nose that's soaked in some kind of odorifugous liquid.</p> <p>What did you say? Only a day he's been like this. Usually the symptoms come on much slower. Some of the patients have been infected for weeks. Either this is a strain we don't know of or your friend is suffering from something different. I certainly wouldn't mind taking a closer look if you have any more details.</p> <p>Flick: i notice that this started when he (eyes Cyrowan) joined up with us.</p> <p>Cyrowan: ever since I knew master fez, his cleanliness has been a bit of an issue. he does try to pawn it off on others. but it's one of my primary duties.</p> <p>Flick: this is one of the areas where Cyrowan is prevaricating or lying about what might be going on. -- Cyrowan is part of split; he's lying but believes his own lies.</p> <p>Cyrowan: I wouldn't blame myself or master fez; some of us have to deal with this from birth.</p> <p>Flick: I don't think anything bad happened in that underground temple.</p> <p>Cyrowan: He's been like this since I knew him. The first person I knew was Vengeance. I haven't found <em>him</em> to be smelly, as much as his presence offends the rest of you.</p> <p>Odeshka: yeah, this doesn't seem to be the marsh sickness, about which you don't know anything.</p> <p>JL: we know a little about a lot of things, but this isn't one of them.</p> <p>Odeshka: we get a lot of people in the town who crossed through the steaplepeak marshes; a lot of them are birdwatchers or entomologists or biologists; before they can make it to the marshbout marsh they are overtaken by this sickness which seems ultimately to convert their bodies into peat, soil, and salt crystals.</p> <p>Flick: yeah we hope that's not happening to our friend. his only symptom is the smell -- which is different.</p> <p>Odeshka: yes, my care may not be the most efficatious here. let me get one of our spiritual leaders.</p> <p>She walks over to the temple and speaks to a very small person -- a child, wearing the same garb. maybe a spiritual child prodigy or something? they come over, carrying a staff, which is a serpent curled around a quarterstaff. in the serpent's mouth is a black, multifaceted gem, with hundreds or thousands of facets. it could be jasper or obsidian or something.</p> <p>flick (yes, i associate that symbol with healers in the cressida region. that strikes me as medical.)</p> <p>the child comes over. My name is Vaka, and I am the head priest here. Odeshka told me you have someone who does not have the marsh sickness, but needs spiritual help.</p> <p>Vengeance: See, that's what you should sound like by now, Cyrowan?</p> <p>Cyrowan: Isn't that what I do sound like? Fez has never given me vocal lessons.</p> <p>Vaka: no matter with this piercingly voiced creature</p> <p>Vengeance: maybe you and Cyrowan can have a discussion between you two.</p> <p>Vaka: can you bring the halfling down here? Flick thinks about lowering the cot but picks Fez up and brings him down.  Vaka: thanks, my height isn't what it used to be.</p> <p>Fez's health has deteriorated significantly. his head lols back and his eyes are unfocused.</p> <p>Vaka puts the gem of the staff against Fez's forehead, and concentric black rings start to radiate outward from the point of contact and outwards towards fez's extremities.</p> <p>Flick looks at Cyrowan, and the same concentric rings are appearing across his body. Cyrowan doesn't really notice at first, and then you can see that little black buds start to emerge from his body that look someone like the tentacles he used against Gorph.  Vaka pulls the staff away when he sees this on Cyrowan.</p> <p>Vaka: it appears that your friend is under the influence of a great evil, which controls, or at least retains, some kind of eye on him through a proxy, but I'm not sure what that could be (nodding surreptitiously towards Cyrowan.) It's difficult to fathom that you would be unaware of the identity of the proxy, so I can only assume that they haven't made contact with you.</p> <p>Flick advances on Cyrowan, grabs him by the shoulder, and muscles him into the street.</p> <p>Cyrowan: Mistress Flick, you're going to leave Fez alone with that child priest?</p> <p>At the street, Flick throws him in front of her trying to cast him onto the ground. as his ass hits the ground, she brings her bow around and drwaw on him. &quot;You have 5 seconds to deliver a satisfactory explanation for your presence and fez's deterioration or god help me i will make a motherfucking pincushion out of you.&quot;</p> <p>JL gets behind Cyrowan to tabletop him.</p> <p>Vengeance to [Vaka]: what's the deal with your height? you said you used to be taller?</p> <p>Vaka: Yes, all <a href="/marshbout/factions/Manusa.html">Manush</a> shrink in height as we age. and he lets the illusion drop, and the bottom half of his body is serpentine.</p> <p>Vengeance: this makes a lot more sense</p> <p>Vaka: yes, you know , all snakes get smaller as they age. it removes the largest layer and you get smaller.</p> <p>Vengeance: so you just have a ton of layers of skin that you shed throughout your life?</p> <p>Vaka: it's sort of like our existing body gets more compressed, and stronger and efficient as we age, so we need less bulk. it's sort of like the cutting phase. it doesn't matter; we have biology tests inside the temple.</p> <p>Vengeance: so how big do you start?</p> <p>Vaka: did you see the guards?</p> <p>Vengeane: how old was she?</p> <p>Vaka: maybe six months?</p> <p>Vengeance: she's pretty ornery for six months</p> <p>Vaka: well she's going through a teething phase. we set them up as receptionists trying to establish kind of a sense of duty and work habits in the young; for outsiders it's quite intimidating.</p> <p>Vengeance: it must hurt if your bones are getting more and more dense</p> <p>Vaka: yes, it does, you kind of have inverse growth plates. but at the same time you're secure in the knowledge that you're stronger than you've ever been.</p> <h3 id="out-in-the-streets"><a href="#out-in-the-streets" class="header-anchor">#</a> Out in the streets</h3> <p>Flick draws her bow, grabbing the arrow and whispering &quot;find his heart&quot; (hunter's mark)</p> <p>Cyrowan: i appreciate all your concern for master fez, but you should know by now it takes more than 5 secondns for me to get out a greeting. other than being fez's squire -- thta's my motivating impulse in life. it is true that i don't remember much of my life before I met vengeance. and … it is strange that I can grow tentacles and levitate people. (flick sees a stream of wetness, closer to the mammary line, emerge (is it pee?) )</p> <p>when she had said &quot;find his heart&quot;, the arrow pointed towards his mid-thigh.</p> <p>cyrowan: sometimes I do hear advice coming to me; i thought it was from one of the recesses of my brain, but it does appear to emerge from a deep sea creature. something with tentacles and an immortal hatred for the surface world.</p> <p>Vengeanec: &quot;that's puberty!&quot;</p> <p>Cyrowan: yep, that's puberty. -- I hope that's enough of an explanation.</p> <p>Flick: well, to the innocent shell, my apologies, and shoots at Cyrowan's thigh</p> <p>(rolling initiative)</p> <p>the vibration of the arrow erases it from fletching to the point, and out of it grows a scintillating needle of force that is going to fly and strike cyrowan in the thigh (aka planar warrior)</p> <p>his body is wracked by the force pumelling. mistress flick, what else can I tell you? he scrambles backwards, unknowingly towards JL.</p> <p>flick: not good enough! and knocks another arrow and shoots. cyrowan's guts and heart chamber? fall out of his thigh, and then he collapses onto the ground in a puddle of organs.</p> <p>flick to self: this wasn't my fault. something was wrong with the guy.</p> <p>flick finds JL's eyes. &quot;I really thought that would go differently&quot;</p> <p>JL: i'm not sure why you thought it would, but I'm not broken up about it.</p> <p>as flick looks for another life force to target, cyrowan's body starts to levitate, but it's sort of like the magician's trick where you're holding yourself up by a foot. his intestines, which have become tentacles underneath him, like an upside-down anemone.</p> <p>flick: THIS is how i thought it would go.</p> <p>cyrowan's head cracks backwards, so that it's full flat against his back and looking up at the heavens. &quot;cyrowan&quot; per se is gone. they hear a voice, which fez could attest to having heard. &quot;seduce the righteous&quot; they both get DIS on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.</p> <p>you fools! don't you know that fez has given up his claim on Ulimara, and she has cast him back on the sea for whoever would take him. i thought he would be wise enough to take me up on the bargain; and now you wish to take from him his only access to these deific powers? if he doesn't want me, and none of you want these powers, than your lives are forfeit when next we meet.</p> <p>JL: scarier things than you have made these threats</p> <p>abzu: i doubt you would say that if we met face to face. and as you can see i can appear in the most unlikely guises, such as this never suspected curious juvenile of a man. you always thought he was upright and following fez's orders.</p> <p>vengeance: i knew all along</p> <p>abzu: you did not!</p> <p>flick can feel that there's something to what it's saying, as much as she doesn't believe it. [wisdom saving throw] flick really has to hype herself up internally to get her hunter's mark to land. suddenly she doesn't know where in her mind she could mark a creature, but it eventually lands.</p> <p>abzu: did you feel that, elf? feeling like that can be your eternal torment</p> <p>flick: you know my name</p> <p>abzu: i do, but it's more ominous to say &quot;elf&quot; . and your full name is pretentious, and i'm not going to use a nickname.</p> <p>vengeance: just think of him as a giant donut, JL! not a jelly donut, obviously</p> <p>JL does hit, sinking his rapier into the cadaver; the whole thing deflates at his touch, and it whispers: you'll be seeing me. and the cadaver goes limp on the ground.</p> <p>JL: great, we've made another creepy enemy.</p> <p>Vaka turns to look up at Vengeance and winks: I think whatever I've done here has taken effect quite quickly on your friend. as JL and flick return, fez has fallen into a restful sleep and no longer emanates that smell</p> <p>vengeance: vaka, you truly are a miracle worker. but i have to wonder if, given what you said, Fez <em>is</em> the parasite.</p> <p>vaka: from the perspective of the deities, that could very well be the case. it may be why he's been cast off in this way. i can no longer sense his connection to his paladin patron.</p> <p>flick: he'll have to take care of that himself.</p> <p>vaka: from what i know of the oaths of the halflins, he must recommit himself before he can see another's powers shine through him.</p> <p>vengeance: what happened to that boy that was with us?</p> <p>flick: the boy?</p> <p>vengeance: no, no.</p> <p>vaka: the halfling is quite small -- is that?</p> <p>flick: you mean cyrowan?</p> <p>vengeance: yeah yeah that's his name. i hope he's ok.</p> <p>flick: his troubles are over</p> <p>vengeance: cool.</p> <p>vaka: with my excellent human hearing i could tell he was dispatched outside the walls. thank you for not blaspheming the temple with that act.</p> <p>flick: i wouldn't do you like that.</p> <p>vaka: one never knows what outsiders will bring into a sacred temple</p> <p>JL: yeah --- we've been guilty of that a time or two</p> <p>flick: that's true, we've definitely profaned a thing or two.</p> <p>vaka: see, i wasn't wrong to worry. in any case, i don't know if your errands bring you here for other reasons, but you're more than welcome to put him up at the temple. we can't offer accommodations. most of the space inside is for residence, and even our medical beds have been extended beyond capacity. i have at least 1 or 2 relatives who would open their doors to you, or I can recommend a place. probably for a small donation ?</p> <p>vengeance: so … could i have that staff?</p> <p>vaka: i'm sorry the staff is of personal and sociocultural meaning to us here so i have to refuse you the staff</p> <p>JL hits vengeance to shut up.</p> <p>JL gives Vaka 4 ? gold pieces</p> <p>vaka: ah, Jean-Luc, such a mighty beneficence. any resources we have are at your disposal. i'm sorry i can't offer a tour of the temple as its closed for renovations.</p> <p>JL: i only ask that you take good care of our bed and point us toward a comfortable bed and warm fire for the evening.</p> <p>flick: i don't feel comfortable in any establishment, but you've been roughing it with us so why don't you call the shots.</p> <p>JL: i could go for a taste of the good life again. if not the plaza, then the upper echelons.</p> <p>as they pass by the plaza, some fall festivities are going on, and the fisherpeople are displaying their fish; huge fish are on display, and for sale -- softshell clams and crustaceans from steaplepeak marsh. all sorts of goods and wares for sale. trinkets and gems have been mined and brought from the zinc hills.</p> <p>flick &amp; jl: ready for bed</p> <p>vengeance: i'm still ready to party. should we get some squid on a stick and buy some weapons</p> <p>JL: i have been meaning to find a good dagger</p> <p>inn: <a href="/marshbout/locations/monarchs_pelt.html">monarchs pelt</a></p> <p>Hat Basket contact: <a href="/marshbout/creatures/rosindra.html">rosindra</a></p> <p><a href="/marshbout/creatures/Yolindar.html">Yolindar</a> is the Gaol Maiden leader who wants JL on a pike</p> <p>vengeance got some shrimp from an old man who tried to give him a hand job</p> <p>flick reads a lot of true crime</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/hafdon/obsidian-general/edit/main/sessions/recaps/session_042_so_i_guess_i_am_kind_of_a_receptionist.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help improve the page?</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
