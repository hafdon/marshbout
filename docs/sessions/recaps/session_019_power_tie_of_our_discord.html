Meanwhile, <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Curculio.html">Curculio</a> approached Drav, Fez and Paros about a message she had been sent by her friend [Wodden] just after he escaped the confines of a <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/mirror_lake.html">magic lake</a>. Curculio believed that playful <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/Flowerfolk.html">flowerfolk</a> were known to swarm to the lake's bittersweet magic and, if seen, could serve as guides. Paros worried that <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Baphomet.html">../../creatures/Baphomet</a> posed a serious threat to the flowerfolk. Fez unhelpfully misheard Baphomet as &quot;Bear Vomit.&quot;</p> <p>Paros went on to insult [human-fox news] (a competent verb runt<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, which Fez believed unlikely until told of the logically rigorous [63-letter alphabet employed by many canids].</p> <p>Curculio, taking a moment to size up [Turtle]'s gastronomical potential, proceeds to describe her home cuisine of [../../creatures/schilpad stoofpot] maligns [a halfling language orthography for consisting of only &quot;bowls and sticks&quot;]. Curculio mentions [Doodril Frogwart's Secular Healing Clinic] was not only prolific, but prolithic, as [he had penned a few flimflammminy articles on healing crystals] from barley] he used at the castle. Out of nowhere, Fez, determined to save the face of his people, declared that [&quot;in our world, flowers are the children's money.&quot;]</p> <h3 id="the-ghost-in-the-woods"><a href="#the-ghost-in-the-woods" class="header-anchor">#</a> The ghost in the woods</h3> <p>Continuing south through the forest, the group came across an innocuous ghost trapped in what appeared to be an insubstantial, evolving maze. When Fez approached, he was recognized by the spirit, which resolved into the likeness of <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/cpt_juna_merrigold.html">Cpt. Juna Merrigold</a>. Juna revealed that the death of <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/von_veen.html">von_veen</a> released her from her piscine hybrid form; however, before she could arrive at the ultimate destination on her postmortem journey, she was redirected into the [limitless maze]'s influence in play, Drav thought it highly likely that [an entity enjoying a boon of Baphomet], allowing one to encase people or spirits in demiplanar mazes, might be siphoning life energy from Juna.</p> <p>As Fez retreated into the seomra crann<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> to clear his head and bladder, Paros, Curculio, and Drav notioned using Turtle as merely a catalyst and seasoning for a &quot;[turtle bath stew], but then apologized when Fez clarified that the fur in the stew was merely shorn from willing foxes rather than made of their pelts. Paros forgot the difference between the words &quot;hasty&quot; and &quot;tasty&quot; before trying to work out with Fez the mathematics of [a hypothesized interdimensional snail for which every journey was &quot;an hour and 50 miles].&quot;</p> <h3 id="tusternoof"><a href="#tusternoof" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tusternoof</h3> <p>At that point, the gang witnessed Juna's form torn apart like curtains being drawn open as an entish creature with a motile deerskull for a head, vines and leaves streaming off its body like a tattered cloak, stepped through the opening. Announcing itself as &quot;<a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Tusternoof.html">Tusternoof</a>&quot; or &quot;The twisted one,&quot; it attempted to imprison the adventurers in mazes like that restraining Juna. After a debate on the competing merits of halfing, grenlich, and tusternoofian [land husbandry] handling intricate [metalwork skullcaps made of a reddish-gold alloy].</p> <p>Fez harnessed the incredible power of his mind-thoughts and collapsed the carceral psychic construct, appearing back on the material plan in a series of thin slices which coalesced into his physical form -- an event which would certainly not have any future effect on him. Drav and Paros summarily defeated Tusternoof with well-placed blobs of pure elemental energy.</p> <h3 id="flowerfolk"><a href="#flowerfolk" class="header-anchor">#</a> Flowerfolk</h3> <p>With the monster dead, the forest sprang to life, and Fez was drawn to a member of the Flowerfolk in a nearby tree. The creature, named <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Ashtai.html">../../creatures/Ashtai</a>, resembled a domestic rabbit comprised entirely of pale red and violet flower petals, and declared itself in the midst of its vacation. Paros shattered the tranquility of its aestivation by warning Ashtai of [Baphomet's plans to absorb the power of the Flowerfolk], receiving in return nothing but visions of holocaust. Unsure as to whether this was an oracle or had already transpired, Paros communicated his anxiety to the party. Drav recalled reading [the minutes of a colloquendo conducted by dwarven geomancers], which was reputed to guard and protect Thuslubber. Drav suggested that perhaps Mogesh could be convinced to extend its aegis to the bloemenwet.</p> <p>The group pondered what step to take next.</p> <p>— <a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/contributors/artemis_tapples.html">Artemis Tapples</a></p> <h2 id="notes"><a href="#notes" class="header-anchor">#</a> notes</h2> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>DM ONLY</summary> <p>all just defeated kolmy thaz being talked into returning to village by flick</p> <p>Curculio message brought to me by raven ; one of the clues might indicate that might friend might be somwhere around here. they had mentioned something about a lake. after they had been trapped in this area by a lake they couldn’t get out of. wodden (friend) somehow managed to break the spell and get out of the vicinity. and i heard there is a lake nearby like that. it moves around and it difficult to locate. if you know the area well we might be able to</p> <p>fez intrigued by idea of a body of water that’s not always in the same place. rides over on Turtle.</p> <p>curculio: riding or eating: fez: mostly riding; it does eat things tho</p> <ul><li>the turtle will bite or eat, but won’t be bitten or eaten C: the ones we ate looked like big beach balls. only nominally turtles fez: ball-based C: discovered them near rocks rounded by action of ocean; slide around almost frictionlesssly in trenches. you do have a bit of the sea to you. fez is “his sea-ness”; john sea-nuh</li></ul> <p>halfling is a language, and written infrequently, and fez speaks it dm: language is just the bottom half of the alphabet “bowls and sticks: a confusing language for a charming people; an abecedarium or alphabetical primer” published by doodle’s toodle’s Doodril Frogwart’s juvenile imprint. has these suspicious clinics that pop up .
