(debi) — drav: did juniper ally with the gnomes? does she want von veen back? — why was juniper helping them kill us? — paros: is juniper helper of von veen ? — joan: why was three-school in candy factory — ethel: we came downstream on river; juniper's task is to learn about mysteries of life and death; calls herself a death doctor — she was drawn to this place because certain things were happening at edge of life and death that would help her find answers — joan: why are you in allegiance with J? — ehtel: it's our mission — joan: so, are you totally neutral to our group? — ethel: if there were no 3-school i would be neutral, and we would protect you until juniper is born again — ethel: (sad) you're going to ignore me? — joan: well, not worry myself — drav: why did juniper ally with the gnomes? — ethel: she wanted to stay alive?  — paros: so she's a travelling scholar? — ethel: yes, she's like a practical rather than academic scholar.  — juniper's fascinated by what von veen is doing with uuget — dot dot doesn't have anything to do with uugeeet that you can tell — paros: was dot dot looking for someone? mostly other images — carlos: were there environmental images? — drav: the patterns on the boxes is still contained — paros: image of box opening (like you've shown a human someone's skin being taken off with a question mark) — drav: does dotdot feel hollow?  — not shaking inside — joan: &quot;don't we all&quot; — drav: comprehend language with arcana — an old language that was used by artificers; a few affectations that gnomes might include — maybe an ancient gnome artificer, or maintained by recourse to it (like latin) -- its powerhelping anchor — words for reassure and comfort and repair  — another box comes over with antennae-like wiggle to joan — size of the larger ipad box — ones that came in, it wiggles, then aims to leave, and sees that dotdot isn't coming after it, and  — joan: it's imprinted,  — dotdot: not doing anything to fight you — drav pets .. and joan pets drav. .. friend is /  — going up corridor, tunnels, wooden doors, thick oak — slash slides under door — paros wants it to list the files — there's a lit room on the other side — voices: (the gnomes talking) — joan: i'm sick of hearing about how much he loves cammy — (briffa and reginald) — the door does open in — joan tries to intimidate gromes while standing — &quot;who are you; are you eavesdropping on me and reginald?&quot; — joan INTIMIDATION [8]  — briffa steps back a little bit ? (re-say with a little intimidated) — joan: reginald can eat a dick (presumably b/c he's in love with cammy) — briffa: reginald and i are BFFs — reginald: are you a loyal person too?  — i'm beginning to think, we do love you — jake: that went surprisingly well — (jenny slate and gabe liedman) — fireplace, big table, two plushy arm chairs, two regular tables — the xorn named turkey — a gigantic starfish, but turned upside-down. three arms are pointed down, like feet, and three pointed up, acting like arms, a mouth, and one eye above each leg. all closed, looksl ike it's snoring. looks like it's about 6 feet tall, but 400-500 pounds. reddish-brown.  — paros tries to telepathize with it. — dm check for wild magic. — it looks like it's dreaming; you see it pushing its way through rock, like a squid through water. moving through the rock. — coming up against huge hoards / deposits / veins of minerals, and eating them; it eats them until it gorges itself, and burrows back out the way it came. dreams that it's hanging out with the ghomes. carved out a sleeping pit for itself.  — BRIFFA:  — joan THINKS turkey is a chicken — drav: single-minded creatures that look for gems and eat them — has a cooperative relationship with the gnomes — slash is heading towards door on other side — briffa: they keep a lot of the other boxes in good spirits — carlos: we found .. running away from home / and - ( slash hyphen and hyphen and dash) - there was a weird little love triangle, which is weirder bc/ they are brother and sister. .. was seeing both of them. and ran away . this is the aftermath. (so, / and - were seeing ..) has .. ever gone that far away? — briffa: when they get into an emotional state, they'll roll around for a while — one time we had to fish .. out of the river. he was covered in slime and some of the gooey stuff — .. gets so emotional sometimes that he loses his programming, and if that happened he imprinted on you — we can take you to where they are reprogrammed  — briffa: &quot;there's a lot that dystopian about this place&quot; &quot;i had to get up at 10:00 but i wanted to sleep in until 11:30&quot; — &quot;you bitch&quot; &quot;i love you &quot;for sleeping in later. — carlos: can we come to something more consensual than reprogramming — drav: how were the gnomes after fishing .. out of the river — we took precautions. we fished him out with a net and rinsed him out first — we have a prohibition from killing other gnomes here -- i've done a lot of thinking in my poly-sci class; it doesn't seem right, but that's the way it is, in briangle.  — briffa: briangle is upright, but the candylab gnomes creep me out — room for candylab carved out 100 some years ago, when briangle carved out — candylab -- the gnomes creep her out — ( i contradicted myself here) — gnomes were acting differently since before juniper showed up — maybe since 6 months — nexnag been around half a year — carlos: Do they talk to the giant fish ever ? — i have paros roll for wild magic surge — joan looks like she's electrocuted and spins out of hands at drav and carlos and electrocutes them, like a passing vision — smell burnt sausage — briffa: i don't let anyone tell me what to do; not my mom or the giant fish; i don't speak fish; it's a disgusting language; i'm supposed to be more woke because of aquan responsibility classes, because of effect lake is having on our life, because there are no creatures in it anymore, but it's taking a long time to sink in — jake: how long ago did they update the curriculum — briffa: within the last six months — the rest of the boxes are in some part of the town ; does a lot with metals and gemstones; don't know exactly ; a lot of it gets taken to surface and traded with people. if there's an interruption in it, then little guys like turkey will eat the gems and we won't have a chance to stop them. — boxes are attendants  — gemstones are our worms — they aren't our real economy, because gems aren't worth anything; but not totally true because they can be used to channel magic powers — so you're just carrying juniper with you — briffa: i don't ever want to have babies — you look at this body and think yoga teacher ? this body is so short i barely need to stretch it; can't tell the difference between curled up and  — sometimes i don't want to be my best — joan : what will make .. happy? — jake: it will be happier reprogrammed, but artificially — what do you think we should do with .. — gnome called SIK that takes care of them in more mechanical way — just follow / to find sik — &quot;don't want to … MAKE MYSELF CRAZY!!&quot; -- paros — &quot;have you ever heard of confidence … ? that's the same as knowledge&quot; -- joan — alchemical workshop</p> <p>— gnome in the back; big blue rubber welding gloves, or mickey mouse gloves — bright red and white lizard on a finger-up foam glove; sports logo — 40x40 room. workbenches around outside; cluster of stuff in one corner; goggles on and welding something — slash goes straight past gnome, through door at far end; — drav tries to open door — bent metal, rusted, etc in junk pile; another shelving unit that has spare parts , categorized — sik sees them: &quot;excuse me, who are you?&quot; — -- we;re just following tour — -- do you have .. in there ? and yes, i'm sik — are you enrolling at the school? joan-- yes.  — .. imprinted on joan, not the other way around — bracket is in there now; but doesn't have the same chemistry;  — joan: sounds like a drummer — sik: yes, he does drag on the ground a bit — ceramic cube: probably dot got too emotional, it brought their internal bits into neutral place, instead it brought peaks higher and troughs lower; the xorns imparted this power to these ceramic ovens — it shouldn't hurt; it's more like a deep sleep where your alpha waves are at a relaxed frequency — will allow .. ot approach the situation with equanimity, and choose from there. — &quot;only works if you're made from metal and arcane essence&quot; — i made the boxes with my family members and predecessors; — there's no need to make more of them — i could make more if i wanted to — investing them with arcane energy; which is what the engravings are for — puts .. into oven — [x] pulls dank nug in jug ; plays metallica -- &quot;sounds more gentle while you're welding&quot; — boxes establish harmony between gem purifiers and metal purifiers; the energy that flow through can overwhelm the servos; it requires a non-mechanical solution — it equalizes the energy level; outlet if too high; and compensates if it's too low — done with the personalities , rather than through pneumatic or hydraulic mechanical means — sik (female) — jake: what's the deal with the fish — sik: we used to be able to fish in the lake, but within year or last month there haven't been any fishing fish to eat, and all the plant life has died; used to be kelp and algaes and they've all died away — and carcases never came to surface — jake: what do you eat, and where do you get your omega-3s.  — we cultivate mushrooms, and trade for some foodstuffs, and we have farms; hunting parties; some animal farms down here — adding sprinkle-powder to the spliff — do they grow the nugs down here? yes — friend Ragga (raggadochy) spends a lot of her time experimenting with hallucinogens. we used to get powerful ones from the lake; soe are hybrids with lake weeds — jake: we met gnomes at candy factory;  — sik: i like to spend my time with the mechanical creatures — giant ghost fish are legendary and have extraordinary lifespans; they can hide and stuff — are there too many fisherman? do you think the ghostfish is eating everything — it's big but not big enough to do that — plus there used to be great spawnings; fish would come upstream and span in the lake, because it's calm around shoreline, but that's stopped happening — do you think it's dammed somewhere?  — rik: possibly; the whole waterway system is fucked up. — elk, moose, deer, penguin, flame penguins — at the fountain, people would go and pray for large catches from the lake; pray for sea or ocean things; people also treat it as a way to get in touch with the Karnish spirit. — karnish would be an ancient religions course — could talk to one of the professors -- might have to visit the bursar ? the central office (dean of student affairs) — what is the powder ? it does come from the cloaca of the xorns.  — xorns excrete something, and i refine it as powder using a .. type of thing, into this psychedelic powder — multi-color stone disc of joans plays videos like a hologram  — sik asks if joan is checking out her disc — hovers 3 feet above ground; it's 3 feet in diameter and an inch thick; sik jumps onto it  — sik tells joan she just has to attune herself to it — joan has 3 throws of teeth and grows her teeth back — jake: &quot;does it go faster if it's in your mouth&quot; — stump can look like a rabbit, but is also gulab jamun — joan: would be good to know if karnish is good or bad — joan: can she cut off the mask? -- there's no seam — more ornate stonework as they go further into the school; red and white stonework — professor henriette ermann's office (it's a gnome name tho so you're translating from gnomish. means &quot;man who hesitates&quot;?) — joan: what's up with karnish! — carlos : good day dr. ermann.  — ermann: can i presume i'm talking to other doctors? which school do you hail from? is your friend panicking. &quot;school of hard knocks&quot; — &quot;the street school of the streets&quot; — joan: enough small talk — ermann: i'm trying to get my psychiatrist license. tell me about yourself …  — carlos: prescribe her something, AND karnish, AND joan laid an egg — ermann, well she is a female dragonborn  — joan: i'm a virgin! — &quot;the school of getting hard knocked up&quot; — carlos: are you familiar with juniper . ermann -- just that a three-school was in the area. — ermann: there are more three-schools. — carlos: you know how juniper goes through cycles of death and rebirth?  — &quot;what to expect when you're expecting&quot; 0-- what's going to happen to joan and the egg. — ermann: we do have facilities for incubating eggs, not of this kind tho. but they would suffice. — when did egg appear? should probably expect it to hatch within a fortnight. — a one-t-night is ¼ of 2 weeks, so 3.5 days — carlos: is she always sausagy?  — ermann: i think last time one of the gnomes was responsible, but the sausage-like aspect stays relatively consistent.  — drav: what other eggs do you facilitate? — [x] ermann: medical facilities for people birthing eggs; farm animals — carlos: when juniper hatches, will she have her whole personality and memory — she'll have an intuitive desire to put on the mask; once that happens, a lot of her drives and memories will be reinjected — the mask is attached to joan to ensure the birth of the next juniper; but juniper is a consistent being; — juniper won't kill you to get the mask; you're being used as a host to create her. the mask will fall off — can we have a pamphlet? and a course catalog? — and karnish! — KARNOSH = paros + karnish or carlos + karnish {+ gnoshing} — karnish is protector / guardian spirit of the grey tongue — genius loci or tutelary spirit — karnish is all that's left of the great mountain deity when it was a mountain; before the top was severed during a fight amongst the gods; karnish is the spirit, and castle karn is named after — juniper is independent of karnish. 3schols are usually scholars or explorers, and find their way around through investigation or curiosity.  — paros: i'm a scholar/explorer — ermann: my specialty isn't on 3schools. the pattern that keeps them intact preceeds the birth of the first humanoid species. this is an arrangement that came to us from the gods. — carlos: what's their interest in the grey tongue specifically — juniper and hers are interested in looking at life and death; recently the grey tongue has been the locus of a lot of that activity — drav: but that's specific to juniper;  — they all have different raison d'etre — carlos: what's the origin of bad stuff — ermann: it's got worse recently, but started since karnish temporary banished by tangegorish (&quot;quarter of a century ago&quot; years ago) — we'd like to see karnish reinstated; even under domonkos, karnish was able to thrive. things were terrible under tantegorisch.  — carlos: we have a theory about the ghost-fish (gauche-fist) — carlos: one of tantegorisch's clients, von veen, is inside the fish — might be specialty of someone concerning themselves with spirits. i don't have much in the way of magic — paros: what is history medicine like then ? — &quot;dr&quot; of history. ermann: hands you <a href="/obsidian-general/items/secular_ministrations.html">secular_ministrations</a>, penned by doodril frogwarts, burghar and sublunar cognoscente. best seller. i think this should interest you quite a lot. — paros: medicine used to fix history? — what is karnish supposed to look like? — show them the spirit troll — spirit form, and elemental locus form, when she takes on the power and appearance of earth itself, and looks like an avalanche or a landslide of rocks in perpetual motion. she's only appeared in spirit form since she was banished. — &quot;throwing behaviors&quot;  — carlos: can you refer us to another professor?  — point to Ymenestra -- a visiting lecturer. she's a fate-runner . they effect exorcisms by becoming one with the host and drawing out the evil forces possessing them. even if it's a giant fish. her knowledge may be more practical than academic, but she is lecturing here.  — ermann gives joan a sweet high-five — does ermann toke — paros telepathizes — plus paros is kind of a paranoid stoner -- is it wired in here?  — black footed ferrets steal gold.  — phrase: &quot;i'll give it the old nickel try&quot; -- if doing it is worth less than the effort it would take to say &quot;no&quot;. it's a gnomish expression. — to pot — &quot;you should really try this&quot; -- pulls out a jug of white liquid. it's trolls milk.  — paros telepathizes with her again. d20 please.  — she gives them a jug of milk  — tastes like very good milk. and you're not sure if its this, or something else recent, but you feel like you're super-tough now, like nothing could hurt you. — carlos: it's b/c karnish knows were trying to do her will. — carlos: &quot;we all had more than you did!&quot; — homeopathic dosing. — &quot;body by trollmilk&quot; — as you're about to leave, and ermann spots the bracer. paros notices you address her directly.  — &quot;this is how you've been telepathizing with me&quot; — &quot;hi, i'm paros&quot; -- &quot;you make such a good student on the first day, introducing yourself&quot; — it will be an overwhelming source of difficulty if you continue — the bracers are meant to be used only by those who are devotees of dalariel, or those who are skilled in the ways of the mystics.  — a mystic we have here, her name is phoenix molvraki, she's from very far away,  — gives a bracelet -- not only will this make you feel like your arthritis has been cured, but it will suppress the abilities and side effects from the bracer. i'd suggest talking to phoenix. their life has been spent learning about this kind of energy and communication. and i think they can help if you want to persist on this path. — for religious followers, the abilities are granted by who they pray to — paros can just take bracer off; the bracelet is also phoenix's calling card, since she moves around a lot — i wouldn't recommend direct communication yet; it might do permanent damage to you — paros: i had a vision of a friend electrocuting other two. — i'm going to cover my braces here — have you had other signs of psychological intrusion — it could have been any of those things.  — … erodes the distinction between different elements, which can emerge through the bracer that will manifest in real life in time. the visions are harbingers of what's to come. it's hinting at the possibilities. — rolling charisma check — when ermann showed the karnish spirit, you have image of a great war , on one side there are thousands of dragons; on the other side, thousands of giants, some are great wizards, some are mercenaries, and coming to clash in the middle. you feel deep within yourself an ancient hatred for the giants.  — not sure if karnish was giant or part-giant.  — not specific hatred towards karnish, it just called this into her mind.</p></details> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div> <hr class="footnotes-sep"> <section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p><strong>sloom, n.</strong> A restful sleep. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>malicious, spiteful <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/hafdon/obsidian-general/edit/mac/marshbout/sessions/recaps/session_013_the_school_of_getting_hard_knocked_up.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help improve the page?</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
