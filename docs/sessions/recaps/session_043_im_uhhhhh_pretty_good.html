He recognizes this as standard thieves communication, albeit slightly more sinister than necessary. Checking the room to confirm that nothing else has been disturbed, he walks over and investigates the dagger. It looks like an arsenical-bronze blade, and individual strips of rawhide dyed blue, green, and white are tied around the hilt to form a grip. On the obverse is a drawing of the city with a particular house marked with an X. The reverse contains a note in bold calligraphy: &quot;Twilight. Bring the dagger.&quot; Jean-Luc surmises this note is an instruction from the <a href="/marshbout/factions/hat_baskets.html">Hat Baskets</a> (aka the Priest Ground Bag) regarding where and when to meet. Seeing he's in no rush, he lazily enjoys smells of roasting meats, fresh bread, and tangy ale wafting up from the kitchen, set to further delight by comparison with the clean bay breeze and the distant mewing of gulls.</p> <p>Vengeance, chary of the company such environs have no doubt attracted, says to himself, &quot;I hope they don't expect us to make chitchat with the others villagers here.&quot;</p> <p>Flick in frustration examines Shoemaker's <a href="/marshbout/items/goodberries.html">goodberries</a>, beginning to wrinkle and shrink from waterloss. She believes she could preserve their healing qualities and clues as to their ultimate provenance (she wants to see why it's behaving so strangely -- if she's able to show the essence to an arcanist) by preserving them in a jam or a jelly, which would extend their useful lives by a few months.</p> <blockquote><p>A discussion ensues regarding preservation of foods in a bag of holding. It may preserve them more than if they were in the open.</p></blockquote> <p>Walking into the kitchen, Flick asks for two cups of sugar, a canning jar, and some boiling water. One of the chefs, a tall willowy woman with short-cropped brown hair, cautions, &quot;You know you can't make fires in your room.&quot;</p> <p>Flick: &quot;All I want to do is cook these berries on your stove for an hour or two and seal them in a jar in some boiling water.&quot; The chef looks at Flick like she needs to get over herself. &quot;i have to prepare for the guests all day long. i guess -- there's a little room on the hearth -- if you wanna grab a cast iron pot, you can take one, but don't get in the way of anyone.&quot;</p> <p>Flick: &quot;i'm uhhhhhh pretty good at not getting in the way.&quot;</p> <p>Flick ends up with a jam โฆ</p> <blockquote><p>20 hit points worth</p></blockquote> <p>โฆ though she's not planning on spreading it on toast. Nevertheless, Vengeance tries to procure a toasted baguette to spread it on (after Flick gives him a little bit). &quot;Oh nice! continental breads!&quot; and he stuffs his pockets full of them. There are no baguettes, though. Mostly pumpernickles and dense black and brown breads. the seeds are pretty well crushed. there are finer loaves. His desire for a smooth bread experience is matched pretty closely. He usually dips his bread in water, which is why dipping nuts in them is even worse. He also has a 'bread cup' to pour water into, which mostly drains out the sides and then he eats the soggy bread. &quot;Everything I own is actually made out of bread,&quot; he mourns.</p> <p>A little kid decked out in a beanie and a onesie emerges from the kitchen. &quot;Hey can i get you some bread?&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: &quot;ooh, i don't know if i like this. I think I found what i was looking for.&quot;</p> <p>kid: you seem to really be picking through them. people around here don't have great hygiene. i have to wash my hands before each meal.</p> <blockquote><p>The DM thinks that &quot;maybe&quot; this is for religious rather than germ-theory reasons, which would make sense. Luckily, no one calls him on it.</p></blockquote> <p>vengeance: &quot;you mean other people have access to this bread? i thought it was just for me,&quot; he declares, standing in the middle of a very crowded small room with two long wooden tables, six people waiting behind him to get at the bread.</p> <p>vengeance: oh, i assumed they were here for other stuff. geez. josh. sorry. i'll just ve another ten minutes or so.</p> <p>YOU BETTER GET OUT OF THE WAY, WE WANT SOME BREAD HERE. WE WANT BREAD, WE WANT BREAD. as the other guests begin to pound the tables demandingly.</p> <p>vengeance: if you can even call this bread, i'm not sure. i think i'm going to take my business elsewhere.</p> <p>The kid bristles. &quot;People around here love my mother's bread. i'm always been told you should be as nice as you can if it's a stranger you might be impugning.&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: it shouldn't be so hard on me! (he takes a bit of a ceramic bowl and cracks his front tooth). &quot;not again!&quot;</p> <p>the kid digs under the pile for the lightest, creamiest loaf to give to him. it's still loaf shaped. &quot;what's a breadstick?&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: you know what a stick is, right?</p> <p>kid: is it like that?</p> <p>a guy behind vengeance is holding a stick ready to smack some sense into you.</p> <p>vengeance: a perfect example! (and he tries to take a bite of the stick)</p> <p><code>[performance ]</code> it's not quite clear to the ruffian what vengeance is doing.</p> <p>&quot;hey, get off my stick! that's my favorite whopping stick don't try to chew on it. get out of the line!&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: sorry, sometimes everything looks like bread to me. i guess i'm just hungry.</p> <p>ruffian: there's a baker in town if you want to have a go at being an apprentice.</p> <p>flick, meanwhile, has a taste for coffee which she acquired in <a href="/marshbout/locations/Marshbout.html">marshbout</a>. she had to hang around in coffeeklatches. she's in the corner, suddenly abraided from her caffeinated reverie by whatever's happening at the bread table.</p> <p>Flick intuits the presence of vengeance behind a very large threatening man holding a stick. the child interposes himself between vengeance and the other customer. &quot;ok, ok, you wouldn't want to hit a kid, would you? everybody just back up.&quot;</p> <p>vengeance tries to overturn the table with all the bread on it. &quot;i don't know why everyone is making a big deal out of this. all I wanted was one piece of bread so my friend could have some toast with jam. it's not my fault, ok, it's hers&quot; and he points to flick.</p> <p>after vengeance knocks the table over, the kid gets out of the way, &quot;ok you guys can go at him, get him out of here.&quot; six people approach vengeance and go to throw him out of the inn.</p> <p>&quot;you're listening to that beanie boy?&quot; Flick makes some comment a about b-boys</p> <blockquote><p>Breakdancers?</p></blockquote> <p>ruffian: &quot;that's the missus's kid. everybody respects this little tyke&quot;. they all give his beanie a nuggie. vengeance kicks and flails ineffectually, cautioning, &quot;&quot;better check under that beanie and see what he's hiding, I have a bad feeling about this kid.&quot;</p> <p>luckily flick's name is also a word, so no one associated it with a person.</p> <p>vengeance can see that there is an addlepated old woman who latches onto his accusations of the beanie child and eyes his hat suspiciously. everyone else is deaf to his pleas and picks him up and throws him out onto the street.</p> <p>&quot;See, that addlepated woman knows what i'm talking about! listen to her!&quot;</p> <p>through the doorway, she points at vengeance: &quot;cursed you are: cursed!&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: oh no.</p> <blockquote><p>The DM requests a luck check to determine how recently it rained.</p></blockquote> <p>it rained pretty recently: not last night but the night before. it's so muddy that he doesn't get hurt, but he's now covered in a sandy mud.</p> <p>flick turns demitasse upside-down, throws some copper jots onto the tableโฆ</p> <blockquote><p>The DM quotes from Kingkiller #1: The innkeeper's mouth pressed itself into a straight line that was not quite a frown. &quot;Of course,&quot; he said as he emptied his purse onto the table then fingered through the jumbled coins: heavy silver talents and thin silver bits, copper jots, broken ha'pennies, and iron drabs. &quot;Does anyone have a shim?&quot;</p></blockquote> <p>โฆ and follows the crowd out the door, stopping on the way to grab some floor bread.</p> <blockquote><p>To the townsfolk this would be known as flierbรดle (from the Frisian, of course).</p></blockquote> <p>most of the customers are helping the kid get the table upright and put the food back on.</p> <p>vengeance: thanks friend. can you believe the nerve of those people ? they didn't even heave-ho three times.</p> <p>flick: yeah, i noticed that. maybe they do things differently around here, but it didn't seem respectful. (flick gives Vengeance a piece of bread and offers him the jar of goodberry jam)</p> <p>addlepated woman: each number not in a &quot;heave-ho&quot; is left as a curse through which for you to go. my prosody's not what it once was.</p> <p>vengeance: so โฆ i'm double-cursed now?</p> <p>flick: sounds like.</p> <p>DM: sounds like you're only singly-cursed, since they didn't count up their heave-hos.</p> <p>vengeance: so it takes away the curse?</p> <blockquote><p>The DM clarifies that, in fact, each heave-ho is another curse.</p></blockquote> <p>vengeance: so if i'd gotten two curses it would have canceled out? uhhhhhh.</p> <p>JL is still in his room, enjoying the fact he got to wake up in a bed. a nice change of pace. he hears a bit of commotion downstairs. &quot;i don't care what this is, it's not my problem. nothing's on fire and i don't hear bloodcurdling screams.&quot;</p> <blockquote><p>Galen 'reminds' DK that Jean-Luc's toenails look freshly cut, since Vengeance trimmed them last night to make a necklace to ward off curses.</p></blockquote> <p>JL didn't notice -- V has done this enough to be able to do it in people's sleep --</p> <blockquote><p>DK requests to determine whether or not the necklace would have any effect on Jean-Luc. Vengeance's arcana check is a 12.</p></blockquote> <p>it's unlikely, but it's possible that it would could ward off a curse, but probably not at the expense of JL. thsi old lady's curse. but as far as you could tell she didn't have any body parts of yours, and wasn't personally afflicted by what you'd done. the curse has a tenuous hold on you anyway, even if she were powerful.</p> <blockquote><p>ian: is there a kind of magic that has to do with sympathetic attraction? where you require pieces of a thing to exert control. me: absolutely. it doesn't always have a negative connotation. there are cultures where it's part of their world, and for others it's necromancy. sometimes it might be real, and sometimes it might be believed.</p></blockquote> <p>JL heads downstairs, grabs some breakfast tea, some bread and cheese.</p> <p>Vengeance was hoping not so much to absorb the curse into JL, like a voodoo doll shield of JL. Vengeance is trying to Munchausen-by-proxy Jean-Luc so that he comes to depend on Vengeance. (actually curse him and make him sick).</p> <p>Externally, Flick sees Vengeance pull out a necklace of toenails string together with devilfloss. He realizes Vengeance is more occupied with this bit of charm and puts away the jam and stares awkwardly down the street.</p> <p>JL comes over Vengeance muttering over some toenails that might be familiar</p> <blockquote><p>(with a 20 passive investigation, he probably does know.)</p></blockquote> <p>After seeing the dagger this morning he'd probably checked over himself for tattoos, and noticed his nails had been cut -- that he knows exactly what Vengeance has done. (&quot;There may be a time when Vengeance has to die&quot;)</p> <p>JL doesn't believe in folk-magic of this sort, or only of the fringe centers, the way real DK thinks about astrology. (&quot;i think it's cool, but i don't believe in it&quot;)</p> <p>JL looks around to make sure no one's listening, now that they'lre out in public. it's pretty loud, even in the morning. there's the beach market at which also some celebration seems to be happening making a lot of noise.</p> <p>JL : it seems like we should wait for our friends at the Temple to take care of <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Fezziwig_Hornswoggle.html">Fez</a>. How do you feel in the meantime about getting involved in the local thieves' guild?</p> <p>Flick: YesSssssss!</p> <p>JL: i should warn you, -- the reason I fled <a href="/marshbout/locations/kriobolis.html">Kriobolis</a> is that the local thieves' guild put a price on my head, and these people also have a gripe with the <a href="/marshbout/factions/gaol_maidens.html">Gaol Maidens</a>. we might have a mutual interest then, but it's possible that they might try to kill us. i'm pretty sure they won't, but it's not out of the question.</p> <blockquote><p>The Demerast Saga is mentioned for the first time.</p></blockquote> <p>vengeance: purely out of curiosity, what was the price?</p> <p>JL: i'm not sure, but you're welcome to try to collect</p> <p>[JL is intimidating Vengeance out of being serious. Vengeance doesn't even notice that JL is trying to intimidate you. ]</p> <p>Vengeance: Yeah, maybe I will. Um, how are you feeling today, JL. are you feeling โฆ cursed at all?</p> <p>JL glances at the necklace and shrugs. well i slept in a bed, I had breakfast to eat, I'm in a city , and nothing is trying to kill me, so i'm better than i've been in a few days.</p> <p>vengeance: definitely nothing is trying to turn me into a bag of bones</p> <p>JL: but i should warn you that the GMs are quite capable of collecting the bounty and we shouldn't take them lightly.</p> <p>JL notices that as Vengeance fingers his necklace, two of the toenails fall off, being insecurely tied to the string. JL calculates that over time the necklace will disintegrate of its own accord.</p> <p>where the necklace falls in the sandy dirt of the street he sees a metallic glint. JL picks it up. it's a very simple circle and pin brooch that bears a distinctive design. creatures carved into it; something that looks like a lion, and a goat, carved delicately around the circle.</p> <p>JL: [history]</p> <p>flick: is this a clue?!</p> <p>JL: there's a kingdom -- lowest ithsmus on the right; a kingdom that when he was learning old thieves' legends, was rumored to have been started by a group of seafaring pirates who settled down and formed coastal communities to raid the surrounding areas. over time it became an empire, which would take advantage of the agricultural people in the hinterlands. these two animals were on their crest. the empire itself is even considered to be historical by this point. he can't be sure what modern use the symbols are being put to. just by looking at the item, it looks like it was made recently to evoke that imagery of that empire (exploitative piracy).</p> <p>it looks like it's made out of <a href="/marshbout/locations/sandford.html">sandford</a> brass. JL puts it in his pockets.</p> <p>JL wants to take a day to enjoy things not trying to kill him.</p> <p>they head towards the southern harbor district. Flick follows JL, but thinks they shoould look in on Fez too. he's about 3/4 of a mile away in the direction of the harbor.</p> <p>[1:22]</p> <p>On the outside it looks like Alphonse Alpothecary. they were told to go in and ask for a lotion that matches your dagger.</p> <p>vengeance: wait, before you go in there, did you see the sign? (he can barely walk because he's laughing too hard, dropping ever more toenails ffrom the necklace like breadcrumbs. ) DK: you have at MOST ten toenails. IAN: you could break them smaller. DM: you might be leaving an actual trail of breadcrumbs.</p> <p>JL walks in, produces the dagger, and asks for a matching set. I think just a few have come in and they're going to be in the back room. he walks to the front, locks the door, and draws the blinds shut. behind the counter is a trap door with stairs leading down into a basement space.</p> <p>JL to himself: standard back-roo criminal fence stuff. no guy obviously standing in the shadows ?</p> <p>Vengeance runs inside and says, &quot;I'm privileged too.</p> <p>JL: the archer's with me. the monk i take no responsibility for.</p> <p>Alphonse: old monk, are you lost here? have you mistaken this for a place off sanctuary?</p> <p>vengeance: i'm hoping it will be, but i did have a question. do you happen to do custom weapons here.</p> <p>alphonse: we don't --- as you can see this is entirely an apothecary, we havae potions and lotions and medicaments and ointments and jointments. do you desire any of these things?</p> <p>vengeance: oh yes. uh. (and tries to wink) i would like one of your &quot;sharpest&quot; ointments. something that really &quot;cuts the air&quot;. something &quot;pungent&quot;. im not great at this double-talk. i need a real weapon.</p> <p>JL: the monk is with me, begrudgingly.</p> <p>Al: ok, follow behind us.</p> <p>downstairs doubles as al's recreation center. a few intellectual board games. plush chairs. the floor is covered in very nice rugs. it looks pretty cozy. it reminds you of rovine's study under the <a href="/marshbout/locations/xanthuc_temples.html">Xanthuc Temples</a>. fewer books, though. al is not an intellectual. there's an array of pipes and tobacco, pipes made from bones and animal parts. this might be akin to a bachelor bad.</p> <p>al: if we had to get rid of your friend here, i was going to say that we were just going to fuck, and that would i imagine have gotten rid of him.</p> <p>JL: it wouldn't have; i shudder to think how he would have responded.</p> <p>al: a companion after my own nature, then. well met, old monk.</p> <p>vengeance: i mighth have been put off by it, but a man of your sense of humor, i have to forgive you anything.</p> <p>al: you sure are good for the heart. they do teach monks the arts of courtesy these days. i must say you're a shining example.</p> <p>JL: i was hoping to find a set of daggers for close-quarters combat (stabbing rather than slicing)</p> <p>al: why didn't you visit the more traditional armorers in town?</p> <p>JL: the standard daggers are someone clumsy. i need something more refined</p> <p>al: we do indeed deal in</p> <p>[1:31]</p> <p>Al goes over to nice benches that line the walls, carved in geometric patterns; they don't look like they can be opened, but he places his hand on the top and runs it along the edge, and suddenly the tops become hinged and they open. he motions them over.</p> <p>&quot;yes these are my daggers here. there are some masterworks -- small throwing daggers, stilettos, singel-edge, dual edge. they all look well-crafted; they are of some kind of pleated, folded metal (like damascus steel). these are all laid out on a plush surface. on the right are a few in boxes.</p> <p>&quot;these over here require a special touch; they are extraordinarily expensive; i must maintain my intimate quarters down here, but it seems that the ones visible are probably to your taste and ability to purchase.</p> <p>flick: are you calling us poor?</p> <p>al: not poor, certainly.</p> <p>JL: shut up!</p> <p>al: i can see that Berchazius has had his hands on you recently (the shrimp merchant). you're just not the tippy top of the elite. i don't see any of you having a trust fund.</p> <p>JL: if only we were in krobopolis, or krebolis, or whatever . crapple-toppolis?</p> <p>JL reaches towards the stiletto points.</p> <p>al: monk, what is your name</p> <p>vengeance: you know, i change it so often. you can call me (french) vengeance</p> <p>al: speaking of touching, if you'll allow me</p> <p>al reaches out and touches vengeances, and vengeance turns into a straw mannequin of himself. &quot;your friend here will provide an excellent mannequin for target practice. he should experience no pain and retains at least the better part of a quarter of his awareness while the spell lasts. it's only five or ten minutes or so. it looks like straw, but it provides the give of flesh.&quot;</p> <p>flick: what in the fucking world</p> <p>JL: i pick up the stiletto and [investigation check] (+2 attack, +1 damage masterwork . if he's looking for something rarer, it's probably in the little boxes.)</p> <p>JL resists the temptation to stab Vengeane. &quot;these feel quite nice, how much&quot;</p> <p>al: let me see here, what are we working with: -- for this one here, i think it would be about 250 of the king's coin. i don't necessarily need gold tho. i accept gems too: quite easy to fence as long as you're not crystals of catarryth, are you?</p> <p>JL holds open the bag of gems from the burrowlings.</p> <p>al: oh my whever did you get this? it looks like a hoard of one of our rodentia friends.</p> <p>JL: good eye. they didn't need them anymore.</p> <p>al: i'll bet. it's a question whether or not they need them to begin with. it appears they are quite susceptible to this kind of mineral madness.

JL doesn't see anything overtly sinister about it. there is a kind fo back alley for horse or cart traffic that connects to the roads on either sides, and a small fenced-in area in the back. to spy on it, he'd have to get up top, or view the back rooms through the houses on the other side of the back alley.</p> <p>JL: it seems like it would be a poor guest to spy now, and instead check in on Fez.</p> <p>They avoid the guardds at the front and head directly for the infirmary. the pavillion top has expanded, and more shade is being provided to those inside. there don't appear to be more patients than there were before.</p> <p>They see Odeshka but not Vaka. Fez has been moved to the other side; they're keeping open beds closer to the entrance. he's on a cot with an umbrella, a washcloth across his forehead, loose blankets and just in his underclothes.</p> <p>Flick and vengeance <code>[nat 1 perception]</code> thinks his cheeks are raging with fire. Even the little vengeance knows about monastic healing tells him that Fez is probably fine.</p> <p>Flick: omg, has anyone looked in on him at all?</p> <p>Odeshka: our generosu donors, how are you doing today. have you come to check on yoru friend?</p> <p>Flick WHAT DID WE GIVE YOU</p> <p>JL: i gave them five gold</p> <p>Flick: Fez looks like he's barely going to live through the night, what's going on with him.</p> <p>Odeshka: no, he's been recovering miraculously. Vaka said it wasn't the marsh sickness. he's been resting and barely talking in his sleep. follow me.</p> <p>close up flick can see that he's not sweating, there's no pallor, and he's not exuding a fisih aura. every other person has dried herbs hung up around him, but they haven't had to around Fez</p> <p>Odeshka: he's here as an unusual patient. we give him the same level of care, but he'll recover much quicker. we don't have to fight against continual decomp. Vaka told me that the departure of his patron deity is doing the most ot hurt him. almost like his life's purpose has gone out of him, but the body is healthy.</p> <p>this is the first time Flick has heard of Fez being involved with the divine.</p> <p>Odeshka: i assume you'll have to take him back to the Newemp Shire, which may be what he needs to fully recover. or a temple of his patron deity as when he was still in the colors of a paladin.</p> <p>JL notices that Odeshka's canines are noticeably longer than a humanoid. [nat 1 survival] JL identifies her as a sun vampire. (DM clarification: not all vampires are evil, it's a legit species). It's certainly the tannest vampire , and also has that victorian clothing look with the skirt.</p> <p>JL remembers seeing that child's face in the window of the temple yesterday.

this temple here extends at least its length again into the ground.</p> <p>flick: are you here to take your country back</p> <p>fles: that is impossible, for econolgical and religious reasons. but this is still a center of much power for us, so we maintain it that way, and when we can help the locals, we do so.</p> <p>[flick calc 21] - she's telling the truth about what she said.</p> <p>fles: the temple is considered a bit of a curiosity ehre, and we encourage that interpretation.</p> <p>flick: we're glad our friend is doing well, and we have an appointment to keep. we'll bid you a fond farewell.</p> <p>vengeance: one last thing. i wonder if our friend could use a quick prayer to arogya.</p> <p>vaka: are you suggested his new patron should be arogya?</p> <p>vengeance: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. yes.</p> <p>vaka: i've never heard of such a thing.</p> <p>vengeance: he told me if i was ever incapacitated i could make decisions for him.</p> <p>flick: no he didn't.</p> <p>vaka: i assume you can discuss that amongst you. it wouldn't be too late to just ask him when he recovers fully. but i don't know that it's been done before. a halfling -- who isn't more trustworthy than a little halfling to be an ambassador. there's i would hope no need to say this, but you won't speak poorly of us to the town, and we will make sure your friend recovers fully.</p> <p>vengeance: normally i trust all snakes and serpents.</p> <p>vaka: please don't call us snakes</p> <p>vengeance: there's something about this whole situation that doesn't seem right</p> <p>vaka: and from what i've heard from the nurses, noone thinks you seem right, so a sort of equilibrium has been attained</p> <p>vengeance: it takes one to know one</p> <p>vaka: that's pretty redundant to what i said</p> <p>flick: we're not here to break him out of prison</p> <p>vengeance: i was hoping to use my hawk-hatchet</p> <p>[for a moment, the conjunction of the idea of kashtari, teh god of the forge, and that with the idea of forging individualized magic weapons, occurs to you, but then disappears]</p> <p>vengeance: darn. you know โฆ when โฆ</p> <p>flick: it'll come back to you.</p> <p>vengeance: fine, if you just want to sleep and die!</p> <p>vengeance sinks down next to fez's cot and clasps his hands in his. dont worry little bud, we're going to get you out of here.</p> <p><code>[religion check]</code> as vengeance is grasping fez's hands, suddenly a brilliant voice and apiercing white light appears.
