He recognizes this as standard thieves communication, albeit slightly more sinister than necessary. Checking the room to confirm that nothing else has been disturbed, he walks over and investigates the dagger. It looks like an arsenical-bronze blade, and individual strips of rawhide dyed blue, green, and white are tied around the hilt to form a grip. On the obverse is a drawing of the city with a particular house marked with an X. The reverse contains a note in bold calligraphy: &quot;Twilight. Bring the dagger.&quot; Jean-Luc surmises this note is an instruction from the <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/hat_baskets.html">Hat Baskets</a> (aka the Priest Ground Bag) regarding where and when to meet. Seeing he's in no rush, he lazily enjoys smells of roasting meats, fresh bread, and tangy ale wafting up from the kitchen, set to further delight by comparison with the clean bay breeze and the distant mewing of gulls.</p> <p>Vengeance, chary of the company such environs have no doubt attracted, says to himself, &quot;I hope they don't expect us to make chitchat with the others villagers here.&quot;</p> <p>Flick in frustration examines Shoemaker's <a href="/obsidian-general/items/goodberries.html">goodberries</a>, beginning to wrinkle and shrink from waterloss. She believes she could preserve their healing qualities and clues as to their ultimate provenance (she wants to see why it's behaving so strangely -- if she's able to show the essence to an arcanist) by preserving them in a jam or a jelly, which would extend their useful lives by a few months.</p> <blockquote><p>A discussion ensues regarding preservation of foods in a bag of holding. It may preserve them more than if they were in the open.</p></blockquote> <p>Walking into the kitchen, Flick asks for two cups of sugar, a canning jar, and some boiling water. One of the chefs, a tall willowy woman with short-cropped brown hair, cautions, &quot;You know you can't make fires in your room.&quot;</p> <p>Flick: &quot;All I want to do is cook these berries on your stove for an hour or two and seal them in a jar in some boiling water.&quot; The chef looks at Flick like she needs to get over herself. &quot;i have to prepare for the guests all day long. i guess -- there's a little room on the hearth -- if you wanna grab a cast iron pot, you can take one, but don't get in the way of anyone.&quot;</p> <p>Flick: &quot;i'm uhhhhhh pretty good at not getting in the way.&quot;</p> <p>Flick ends up with a jam โฆ</p> <blockquote><p>20 hit points worth</p></blockquote> <p>โฆ though she's not planning on spreading it on toast. Nevertheless, Vengeance tries to procure a toasted baguette to spread it on (after Flick gives him a little bit). &quot;Oh nice! continental breads!&quot; and he stuffs his pockets full of them. There are no baguettes, though. Mostly pumpernickles and dense black and brown breads. the seeds are pretty well crushed. there are finer loaves. His desire for a smooth bread experience is matched pretty closely. He usually dips his bread in water, which is why dipping nuts in them is even worse. He also has a 'bread cup' to pour water into, which mostly drains out the sides and then he eats the soggy bread. &quot;Everything I own is actually made out of bread,&quot; he mourns.</p> <p>A little kid decked out in a beanie and a onesie emerges from the kitchen. &quot;Hey can i get you some bread?&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: &quot;ooh, i don't know if i like this. I think I found what i was looking for.&quot;</p> <p>kid: you seem to really be picking through them. people around here don't have great hygiene. i have to wash my hands before each meal.</p> <blockquote><p>The DM thinks that &quot;maybe&quot; this is for religious rather than germ-theory reasons, which would make sense. Luckily, no one calls him on it.</p></blockquote> <p>vengeance: &quot;you mean other people have access to this bread? i thought it was just for me,&quot; he declares, standing in the middle of a very crowded small room with two long wooden tables, six people waiting behind him to get at the bread.</p> <p>vengeance: oh, i assumed they were here for other stuff. geez. josh. sorry. i'll just ve another ten minutes or so.</p> <p>YOU BETTER GET OUT OF THE WAY, WE WANT SOME BREAD HERE. WE WANT BREAD, WE WANT BREAD. as the other guests begin to pound the tables demandingly.</p> <p>vengeance: if you can even call this bread, i'm not sure. i think i'm going to take my business elsewhere.</p> <p>The kid bristles. &quot;People around here love my mother's bread. i'm always been told you should be as nice as you can if it's a stranger you might be impugning.&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: it shouldn't be so hard on me! (he takes a bit of a ceramic bowl and cracks his front tooth). &quot;not again!&quot;</p> <p>the kid digs under the pile for the lightest, creamiest loaf to give to him. it's still loaf shaped. &quot;what's a breadstick?&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: you know what a stick is, right?</p> <p>kid: is it like that?</p> <p>a guy behind vengeance is holding a stick ready to smack some sense into you.</p> <p>vengeance: a perfect example! (and he tries to take a bite of the stick)</p> <p><code>[performance ]</code> it's not quite clear to the ruffian what vengeance is doing.</p> <p>&quot;hey, get off my stick! that's my favorite whopping stick don't try to chew on it. get out of the line!&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: sorry, sometimes everything looks like bread to me. i guess i'm just hungry.</p> <p>ruffian: there's a baker in town if you want to have a go at being an apprentice.</p> <p>flick, meanwhile, has a taste for coffee which she acquired in <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/Marshbout.html">marshbout</a>. she had to hang around in coffeeklatches. she's in the corner, suddenly abraided from her caffeinated reverie by whatever's happening at the bread table.</p> <p>Flick intuits the presence of vengeance behind a very large threatening man holding a stick. the child interposes himself between vengeance and the other customer. &quot;ok, ok, you wouldn't want to hit a kid, would you? everybody just back up.&quot;</p> <p>vengeance tries to overturn the table with all the bread on it. &quot;i don't know why everyone is making a big deal out of this. all I wanted was one piece of bread so my friend could have some toast with jam. it's not my fault, ok, it's hers&quot; and he points to flick.</p> <p>after vengeance knocks the table over, the kid gets out of the way, &quot;ok you guys can go at him, get him out of here.&quot; six people approach vengeance and go to throw him out of the inn.</p> <p>&quot;you're listening to that beanie boy?&quot; Flick makes some comment a about b-boys</p> <blockquote><p>Breakdancers?</p></blockquote> <p>ruffian: &quot;that's the missus's kid. everybody respects this little tyke&quot;. they all give his beanie a nuggie. vengeance kicks and flails ineffectually, cautioning, &quot;&quot;better check under that beanie and see what he's hiding, I have a bad feeling about this kid.&quot;</p> <p>luckily flick's name is also a word, so no one associated it with a person.</p> <p>vengeance can see that there is an addlepated old woman who latches onto his accusations of the beanie child and eyes his hat suspiciously. everyone else is deaf to his pleas and picks him up and throws him out onto the street.</p> <p>&quot;See, that addlepated woman knows what i'm talking about! listen to her!&quot;</p> <p>through the doorway, she points at vengeance: &quot;cursed you are: cursed!&quot;</p> <p>vengeance: oh no.</p> <blockquote><p>The DM requests a luck check to determine how recently it rained.</p></blockquote> <p>it rained pretty recently: not last night but the night before. it's so muddy that he doesn't get hurt, but he's now covered in a sandy mud.</p> <p>flick turns demitasse upside-down, throws some copper jots onto the tableโฆ</p> <blockquote><p>The DM quotes from Kingkiller #1: The innkeeper's mouth pressed itself into a straight line that was not quite a frown. &quot;Of course,&quot; he said as he emptied his purse onto the table then fingered through the jumbled coins: heavy silver talents and thin silver bits, copper jots, broken ha'pennies, and iron drabs. &quot;Does anyone have a shim?&quot;</p></blockquote> <p>โฆ and follows the crowd out the door, stopping on the way to grab some floor bread.</p> <blockquote><p>To the townsfolk this would be known as flierbรดle (from the Frisian, of course).</p></blockquote> <p>most of the customers are helping the kid get the table upright and put the food back on.</p> <p>vengeance: thanks friend. can you believe the nerve of those people ? they didn't even heave-ho three times.</p> <p>flick: yeah, i noticed that. maybe they do things differently around here, but it didn't seem respectful. (flick gives Vengeance a piece of bread and offers him the jar of goodberry jam)</p> <p>addlepated woman: each number not in a &quot;heave-ho&quot; is left as a curse through which for you to go. my prosody's not what it once was.</p> <p>vengeance: so โฆ i'm double-cursed now?</p> <p>flick: sounds like.</p> <p>DM: sounds like you're only singly-cursed, since they didn't count up their heave-hos.</p> <p>vengeance: so it takes away the curse?</p> <blockquote><p>The DM clarifies that, in fact, each heave-ho is another curse.</p></blockquote> <p>vengeance: so if i'd gotten two curses it would have canceled out? uhhhhhh.</p> <p>JL is still in his room, enjoying the fact he got to wake up in a bed. a nice change of pace. he hears a bit of commotion downstairs. &quot;i don't care what this is, it's not my problem. nothing's on fire and i don't hear bloodcurdling screams.&quot;</p> <blockquote><p>Galen 'reminds' DK that Jean-Luc's toenails look freshly cut, since Vengeance trimmed them last night to make a necklace to ward off curses.</p></blockquote> <p>JL didn't notice -- V has done this enough to be able to do it in people's sleep --</p> <blockquote><p>DK requests to determine whether or not the necklace would have any effect on Jean-Luc. Vengeance's arcana check is a 12.</p></blockquote> <p>it's unlikely, but it's possible that it would could ward off a curse, but probably not at the expense of JL. thsi old lady's curse. but as far as you could tell she didn't have any body parts of yours, and wasn't personally afflicted by what you'd done. the curse has a tenuous hold on you anyway, even if she were powerful.</p> <blockquote><p>ian: is there a kind of magic that has to do with sympathetic attraction? where you require pieces of a thing to exert control. me: absolutely. it doesn't always have a negative connotation. there are cultures where it's part of their world, and for others it's necromancy. sometimes it might be real, and sometimes it might be believed.</p></blockquote> <p>JL heads downstairs, grabs some breakfast tea, some bread and cheese.</p> <p>Vengeance was hoping not so much to absorb the curse into JL, like a voodoo doll shield of JL. Vengeance is trying to Munchausen-by-proxy Jean-Luc so that he comes to depend on Vengeance. (actually curse him and make him sick).</p> <p>Externally, Flick sees Vengeance pull out a necklace of toenails string together with devilfloss. He realizes Vengeance is more occupied with this bit of charm and puts away the jam and stares awkwardly down the street.</p> <p>JL comes over Vengeance muttering over some toenails that might be familiar</p> <blockquote><p>(with a 20 passive investigation, he probably does know.)</p></blockquote> <p>After seeing the dagger this morning he'd probably checked over himself for tattoos, and noticed his nails had been cut -- that he knows exactly what Vengeance has done. (&quot;There may be a time when Vengeance has to die&quot;)</p> <p>JL doesn't believe in folk-magic of this sort, or only of the fringe centers, the way real DK thinks about astrology. (&quot;i think it's cool, but i don't believe in it&quot;)</p> <p>JL looks around to make sure no one's listening, now that they'lre out in public. it's pretty loud, even in the morning. there's the beach market at which also some celebration seems to be happening making a lot of noise.</p> <p>JL : it seems like we should wait for our friends at the Temple to take care of <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Fezziwig_Hornswoggle.html">Fez</a>. How do you feel in the meantime about getting involved in the local thieves' guild?</p> <p>Flick: YesSssssss!</p> <p>JL: i should warn you, -- the reason I fled <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/kriobolis.html">Kriobolis</a> is that the local thieves' guild put a price on my head, and these people also have a gripe with the <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/gaol_maidens.html">Gaol Maidens</a>. we might have a mutual interest then, but it's possible that they might try to kill us. i'm pretty sure they won't, but it's not out of the question.</p> <blockquote><p>The Demerast Saga is mentioned for the first time.</p></blockquote> <p>vengeance: purely out of curiosity, what was the price?</p> <p>JL: i'm not sure, but you're welcome to try to collect</p> <p>[JL is intimidating Vengeance out of being serious. Vengeance doesn't even notice that JL is trying to intimidate you. ]</p> <p>Vengeance: Yeah, maybe I will. Um, how are you feeling today, JL. are you feeling โฆ cursed at all?</p> <p>JL glances at the necklace and shrugs. well i slept in a bed, I had breakfast to eat, I'm in a city , and nothing is trying to kill me, so i'm better than i've been in a few days.</p> <p>vengeance: definitely nothing is trying to turn me into a bag of bones</p> <p>JL: but i should warn you that the GMs are quite capable of collecting the bounty and we shouldn't take them lightly.</p> <p>JL notices that as Vengeance fingers his necklace, two of the toenails fall off, being insecurely tied to the string. JL calculates that over time the necklace will disintegrate of its own accord.</p> <p>where the necklace falls in the sandy dirt of the street he sees a metallic glint. JL picks it up. it's a very simple circle and pin brooch that bears a distinctive design. creatures carved into it; something that looks like a lion, and a goat, carved delicately around the circle.</p> <p>JL: [history]</p> <p>flick: is this a clue?!</p> <p>JL: there's a kingdom -- lowest ithsmus on the right; a kingdom that when he was learning old thieves' legends, was rumored to have been started by a group of seafaring pirates who settled down and formed coastal communities to raid the surrounding areas. over time it became an empire, which would take advantage of the agricultural people in the hinterlands. these two animals were on their crest. the empire itself is even considered to be historical by this point. he can't be sure what modern use the symbols are being put to. just by looking at the item, it looks like it was made recently to evoke that imagery of that empire (exploitative piracy).</p> <p>it looks like it's made out of <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/sandford.html">sandford</a> brass. JL puts it in his pockets.</p> <p>JL wants to take a day to enjoy things not trying to kill him.</p> <p>they head towards the southern harbor district. Flick follows JL, but thinks they shoould look in on Fez too. he's about 3/4 of a mile away in the direction of the harbor.</p> <p>[1:22]</p> <p>On the outside it looks like Alphonse Alpothecary. they were told to go in and ask for a lotion that matches your dagger.</p> <p>vengeance: wait, before you go in there, did you see the sign? (he can barely walk because he's laughing too hard, dropping ever more toenails ffrom the necklace like breadcrumbs. ) DK: you have at MOST ten toenails. IAN: you could break them smaller. DM: you might be leaving an actual trail of breadcrumbs.</p> <p>JL walks in, produces the dagger, and asks for a matching set. I think just a few have come in and they're going to be in the back room. he walks to the front, locks the door, and draws the blinds shut. behind the counter is a trap door with stairs leading down into a basement space.</p> <p>JL to himself: standard back-roo criminal fence stuff. no guy obviously standing in the shadows ?</p> <p>Vengeance runs inside and says, &quot;I'm privileged too.</p> <p>JL: the archer's with me. the monk i take no responsibility for.</p> <p>Alphonse: old monk, are you lost here? have you mistaken this for a place off sanctuary?</p> <p>vengeance: i'm hoping it will be, but i did have a question. do you happen to do custom weapons here.</p> <p>alphonse: we don't --- as you can see this is entirely an apothecary, we havae potions and lotions and medicaments and ointments and jointments. do you desire any of these things?</p> <p>vengeance: oh yes. uh. (and tries to wink) i would like one of your &quot;sharpest&quot; ointments. something that really &quot;cuts the air&quot;. something &quot;pungent&quot;. im not great at this double-talk. i need a real weapon.</p> <p>JL: the monk is with me, begrudgingly.</p> <p>Al: ok, follow behind us.</p> <p>downstairs doubles as al's recreation center. a few intellectual board games. plush chairs. the floor is covered in very nice rugs. it looks pretty cozy. it reminds you of rovine's study under the <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/xanthuc_temples.html">Xanthuc Temples</a>. fewer books, though. al is not an intellectual. there's an array of pipes and tobacco, pipes made from bones and animal parts. this might be akin to a bachelor bad.</p> <p>al: if we had to get rid of your friend here, i was going to say that we were just going to fuck, and that would i imagine have gotten rid of him.</p> <p>JL: it wouldn't have; i shudder to think how he would have responded.</p> <p>al: a companion after my own nature, then. well met, old monk.</p> <p>vengeance: i mighth have been put off by it, but a man of your sense of humor, i have to forgive you anything.</p> <p>al: you sure are good for the heart. they do teach monks the arts of courtesy these days. i must say you're a shining example.</p> <p>JL: i was hoping to find a set of daggers for close-quarters combat (stabbing rather than slicing)</p> <p>al: why didn't you visit the more traditional armorers in town?</p> <p>JL: the standard daggers are someone clumsy. i need something more refined</p> <p>al: we do indeed deal in</p> <p>[1:31]</p> <p>Al goes over to nice benches that line the walls, carved in geometric patterns; they don't look like they can be opened, but he places his hand on the top and runs it along the edge, and suddenly the tops become hinged and they open. he motions them over.</p> <p>&quot;yes these are my daggers here. there are some masterworks -- small throwing daggers, stilettos, singel-edge, dual edge. they all look well-crafted; they are of some kind of pleated, folded metal (like damascus steel). these are all laid out on a plush surface. on the right are a few in boxes.</p> <p>&quot;these over here require a special touch; they are extraordinarily expensive; i must maintain my intimate quarters down here, but it seems that the ones visible are probably to your taste and ability to purchase.</p> <p>flick: are you calling us poor?</p> <p>al: not poor, certainly.</p> <p>JL: shut up!</p> <p>al: i can see that Berchazius has had his hands on you recently (the shrimp merchant). you're just not the tippy top of the elite. i don't see any of you having a trust fund.</p> <p>JL: if only we were in krobopolis, or krebolis, or whatever . crapple-toppolis?</p> <p>JL reaches towards the stiletto points.</p> <p>al: monk, what is your name</p> <p>vengeance: you know, i change it so often. you can call me (french) vengeance</p> <p>al: speaking of touching, if you'll allow me</p> <p>al reaches out and touches vengeances, and vengeance turns into a straw mannequin of himself. &quot;your friend here will provide an excellent mannequin for target practice. he should experience no pain and retains at least the better part of a quarter of his awareness while the spell lasts. it's only five or ten minutes or so. it looks like straw, but it provides the give of flesh.&quot;</p> <p>flick: what in the fucking world</p> <p>JL: i pick up the stiletto and [investigation check] (+2 attack, +1 damage masterwork . if he's looking for something rarer, it's probably in the little boxes.)</p> <p>JL resists the temptation to stab Vengeane. &quot;these feel quite nice, how much&quot;</p> <p>al: let me see here, what are we working with: -- for this one here, i think it would be about 250 of the king's coin. i don't necessarily need gold tho. i accept gems too: quite easy to fence as long as you're not crystals of catarryth, are you?</p> <p>JL holds open the bag of gems from the burrowlings.</p> <p>al: oh my whever did you get this? it looks like a hoard of one of our rodentia friends.</p> <p>JL: good eye. they didn't need them anymore.</p> <p>al: i'll bet. it's a question whether or not they need them to begin with. it appears they are quite susceptible to this kind of mineral madness. (latvian: dฤrgakmens trakums)</p> <p>yes, let me see -- he pulls out a loupe and looks through the bag, picking out a few (pearl, some gemstones). this should make it even. i hate to deprive you of some of the most valuable, if this is your whole store.</p> <p>JL: then we have a deal.</p> <p>AL: was it <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/tishara_vernix.html">Tishara</a> who sent you here, or <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/malenka.html">Malenka</a>? <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/rosindra.html">Rosindra</a>? i know she's been getting on the scene.</p> <p>JL: i think a man of your profession appreciates a little discretion.</p> <p>AL: they will miss out on the commission. they didn't provide a calling card?</p> <p>JL intuits nothing nefarious on the surface, but he's not positive it's just to commission them</p> <p>JL: nope, i jus wandered in by chance.</p> <p>al: seems very unlikely , esp with that dagger, and does seem like discretion is the better part of good relations. (echoed by JL, vengeance). you three, i tell you, we could have been real friends</p> <p>Flick: could you turn our friend into a real boy, now.</p> <p>Al pulls a long saber out from behind his robe, and slices off the head -- the straw superstructure collapses and vengeance is standing there underneath.</p> <p>JL: that's a nice trick there.</p> <p>Al: I'm glad you like it. it took me many years to master. You wouldn't like to know what happened in the intervening years, I daresay.</p> <p>Vengeance: i have quite a headache now. quite a my-grain.</p> <p>alphonse: yes well being an apothecary i can fix you right up with that.</p> <p>vengeance: good, because it's looking to become a haymaker.</p> <p>al: aha, yes, very good, i knew you were funny</p> <p>vengeance: i knew you were a man who would appreciate it</p> <p>al: i certainly am. anytime you want to come back here without your fellows is fine by me too.</p> <p>vengeance: hm, well, i actually had a question as to whether you could make a hawk hatchet for me.</p> <p>al: what is that?</p> <p>vengeance: it's sort of like a boomerang, but it has blades on it; it's very difficult to use so only real experts should try. fortunately I am one; i just haven't been able to find it anywhere</p> <p>al: i'm not actually a metal forger, i'm just a middleman. even with your description it's hard for me to picture what you want. i must say, tho, as a custom product it would be even more expensive than the one that your friend here just purchased.</p> <p>vengeance: it shouldn't be too hard to make.</p> <p>he takes a dagger and carves into the wall a stick with two scythe blades on either side. a short, double-sided scythe. nothing like a boomerang.</p> <p>al: so you just need scythe heds affixed to a staff? a peasant weapon?</p> <p>vengeance: well it doesn't look like a boomerang but it behaves like one</p> <p>al: yes, even the name of a maker i don't have for a weapon like that. it sounds like you're looking for a specific artefact or legendary item. is one of its nature told of at the monasteries? it sounds like one of a kind.</p> <p>vengeance: yes, i mean, it's a classic monk weapon, only i was never allowed to use a real one, i had to use the rubber version, which is basically a toy, but I got really good at it, and i'm ready to prove my skills. i thought you were a weapons man!</p> <p>al: as i've said, i'm a middle man, i sell expensive weapons to clientelle who can affor it. i don't make weapons from scratch or traffic in these childlike notions of what constitutes weaponry that may appear to a solitary half-elf in his wanderings through the woods.</p> <p>vengeance; you sure talked a big game about those daggers. and your voice is really cool. still, i'm disappointed that you don't know this.</p> <p>al: well i do a different voice for the apothecary and weapons clients, and it takes a bit of time to transition. i can't help you with the weapon.</p> <p>vengeance; what's the name of that blacksmith again?</p> <p>al: the one who definitely can't do that one?</p> <p>Melford Bloodsledge, she owns a forge neer the Zinc Hills, just once you're north of the city ask for her. it's known that she does pieces for a price, and can be quite discrete when the need arises.</p> <p>vengeance: i just need someone to make it for me, and maybe you can enchant it.</p> <p>al: i can only do parlor tricks, nothing like enchanting a weapon</p> <p>vengeance: dammit, i thought you were a magic man.</p> <p>al: no, that's my cousin Dimitrio. he's the magic man.</p> <p>vengeance: i wish you would have told us you were a middle man at the beginning.</p> <p>al eyes the other two men.</p> <p>flick and JL shrug helplessly.</p> <p>JL: i thnk you for your service, we must be going, i hope our paths cross again.</p> <p>al: let me get you that headache medication. up, up!</p> <p>al goes to the bathroom.</p> <p>vengeance: fancy a trip to this blacksmith?</p> <p>JL: i'm a bit low on coin</p> <p>vengeane: you did lose much of your savings just now. where's the rest of your money?</p> <p>JL: in a bank in kribopolis / krebulis</p> <p>vengeance: do you want to give me the account number in case you forget it?</p> <p>JL: i don't know what that means</p> <p>vengeance: how do you take out funds?</p> <p>JL: you walk into the bank and prove who you are, and then walk into the safe deposit area</p> <p>vengeance: by &quot;proof&quot; do you mean show them your distinctive toenails โฆ [they re basically like fingerprints in this world]</p> <p>[vengeance isn't interested in money, just his friend JL's life. DK: the more poor and destitute he becomes, the more likely he is to rely on you.]</p> <p>they plan to head north of the city just outside Meliansein. Just to the north of that,</p> <p>there's 3 horses stabled there, for her farrier work. she has an open workshop with a large forge, two apprentices, both dwarves, also there, feeding the flames and providing her with equipment and getting metals prepared. there's a courtyard strewn with hay, the house with apprentice quarters is on the other side of the workshop.</p> <p>vengeance: so here's what I'm thinking โฆ these armlets could be melted down into shields . what do you two think?</p> <p>flick: they're pretty small</p> <p>vengeance: well, maybe the material could be spread throughout another metal โฆ shield, so it could still have that protective power.</p> <p>the trio approaches the workshop. flick makes the huge mistake of letting vengeance take the lead.</p> <p>vengeance repeats the above.</p> <p>Melford: well do you know what a &quot;boss&quot; is? it's the rounded part in the middle , it keeps your handguard protected from the other side. it's usually made from metal if the shield's wooden. i think if we pounded them out into a boss -- do you know what they do? it takes me; i do have acquaintance with this kind of material, but it takes me a while to examine its qualities.</p> <p>flick: dead, small creatures in a lake. we're not sure what they use them for.</p> <p>melford: i'm gonna have to identify these, which is an extra cost. do you even use a shield tho?</p> <p>vengeance: maybe i would use a shield. it's not against my religion.</p> <p>melford: well from what i've heard from other monks is that if they use a shield they aren't as agile as they otherwise would be. you do have those fancy goggles tho, what do you use those for.</p> <p>vengeance: just โฆ night swimming, primarily. i guess i could use them as a sleep mask.</p> <p>melford: they do have holes in the eyes, how would you โฆ ?</p> <p>vengeance: they're kind of falling apart, so i pull the splinters over the eye holes</p> <p>melford: so a collection of wood splinters that happen to be formed into a goggle shape</p> <p>vengeance: that's kind of a crass way to put it, but i suppose. maybe a helmet?</p> <p>melford: it's a little too thin, it'd have to be part of a helmet. i could stretch it into a bracelet for you, frankly. or a pendant. or you coul dwaer it that way now. you could just put a string through it. it seems like you had something specific in mind</p> <p>flick: it didn't help those armadillos</p> <p>melford: you're being careful ? those can carry leprosy. i couldn't want you bringing that into down. we're already dealing with the marsh sickness.</p> <p>flick: oh yeah, we saw that on our way in</p> <p>melford: you didn't touch any of those folk, did you? i hear they are very contagious.</p> <p>flick: i think we should -- i don't see any reason to stigmatize people for something not their fault. but we took the proper precautions</p> <p>melford: well as an ex-mountain-dwarf I have to obe careful, i don't have any innate immunities, so the further away i stay the better.</p> <p>flick: vengeance, what's the deal here?</p> <p>melford: i can make a thin choker?</p> <p>flick: that sounds like it ticks some of hte boxes</p> <p>vengeance: that would be perfect, and i should do it anyway, but i don't know if it would be effective in protecting us against whatever killed the armadillos. i think we need a full bodysuit made of this material, otherwise</p> <p>flick: i think what killed them was a meteorite, so</p> <p>vengeance: there could be another one at any second.</p> <p>melford: so these armadillos still died โฆ ?</p> <p>vengeance: i think they made the same mistake of not wearing enough</p> <p>melford: what gives you the notion it's protective at all</p> <p>vengeance: the only parts of them left were the pieces of flesh below the metal</p> <p>melford: what do you mean, that were left.</p> <p>V: iti seemed like they were bones except for what was protected โฆ</p> <p>[DM corrects what he described, which is that the recently killed ones had living tissue under the bracelet. ian: did cyrowan deflate? dm: cyrowan was being artificially animated, but the burrowlings were alive; it looked like their mentation had been changed somehow</p> <p>vengeance: so this would only be useful to us if we were in danger of being deflated</p> <p>melford: did you say fellated? do you want a cock ring?</p> <p>vengeance: if others try to โฆ deflate us ?</p> <p>melford: the notion of deflating is pretty alien to me; frankly if that's what these bracers do i'm not sure i'll be able to transform them</p> <p>flick: i'm 98% sure vengeance is wasting our time</p> <p>vengeance: this metal must be special in some way.</p> <p>melford: i can โฆ</p> <p>vengeance: no, it's pretty much useless to us</p> <p>melford: i have some other weird projects you might be interested in. holdon.

JL doesn't see anything overtly sinister about it. there is a kind fo back alley for horse or cart traffic that connects to the roads on either sides, and a small fenced-in area in the back. to spy on it, he'd have to get up top, or view the back rooms through the houses on the other side of the back alley.</p> <p>JL: it seems like it would be a poor guest to spy now, and instead check in on Fez.</p> <p>They avoid the guardds at the front and head directly for the infirmary. the pavillion top has expanded, and more shade is being provided to those inside. there don't appear to be more patients than there were before.</p> <p>They see Odeshka but not Vaka. Fez has been moved to the other side; they're keeping open beds closer to the entrance. he's on a cot with an umbrella, a washcloth across his forehead, loose blankets and just in his underclothes.</p> <p>Flick and vengeance <code>[nat 1 perception]</code> thinks his cheeks are raging with fire. Even the little vengeance knows about monastic healing tells him that Fez is probably fine.</p> <p>Flick: omg, has anyone looked in on him at all?</p> <p>Odeshka: our generosu donors, how are you doing today. have you come to check on yoru friend?</p> <p>Flick WHAT DID WE GIVE YOU</p> <p>JL: i gave them five gold</p> <p>Flick: Fez looks like he's barely going to live through the night, what's going on with him.</p> <p>Odeshka: no, he's been recovering miraculously. Vaka said it wasn't the marsh sickness. he's been resting and barely talking in his sleep. follow me.</p> <p>close up flick can see that he's not sweating, there's no pallor, and he's not exuding a fisih aura. every other person has dried herbs hung up around him, but they haven't had to around Fez</p> <p>Odeshka: he's here as an unusual patient. we give him the same level of care, but he'll recover much quicker. we don't have to fight against continual decomp. Vaka told me that the departure of his patron deity is doing the most ot hurt him. almost like his life's purpose has gone out of him, but the body is healthy.</p> <p>this is the first time Flick has heard of Fez being involved with the divine.</p> <p>Odeshka: i assume you'll have to take him back to the Newemp Shire, which may be what he needs to fully recover. or a temple of his patron deity as when he was still in the colors of a paladin.</p> <p>JL notices that Odeshka's canines are noticeably longer than a humanoid. [nat 1 survival] JL identifies her as a sun vampire. (DM clarification: not all vampires are evil, it's a legit species). It's certainly the tannest vampire , and also has that victorian clothing look with the skirt.</p> <p>JL remembers seeing that child's face in the window of the temple yesterday. Another glance today bears no fruit.</p> <p>Vengeance reads from his mind palace โฆ &quot;my mental files are unorganized right now, even though the monks spent so much time teaching me mnemonic tricks&quot;. fellows, perhaps you've heard of the Manoosh? the manoosh? they are a group of Naga, and i know you probably don't know what that is, it's a human-snake race. the primary concentration center for them is the Dayama desert, in the middle of the continent. you may recall meeting them here, in this temple. &quot;LEXICON: &quot; vengeance goes into a trance and starts reciting everything he knows.</p> <p>JL: why bring this up, vengeance?</p> <p>vengeance: hm, good question. it might just be helpful, in case, โฆ. oh right, Vaka, is he here?</p> <p>Odeshka: I can see if I can find him inside, and appears with Vaka after a few moments.</p> <p>Vaka: my friends, how do you do this day? i take it you've seen the condition of Fez, recovered so quckly.</p> <p>Flick: our hearts are heavy that there are things your healings skills won't be able to touch, but we're grateful for all you have been able to do.</p> <p>Vaka: it's quite sad; a adventurers, if you could bring you any information from distant realms, i think any of it might be helpful here.</p> <p>Flick: well we met the creature responsible, in a radiant pool under the Xanthuc Temple near the Alldrink.</p> <p>Vaka: yes, we did learn about them in some of our religion classes.</p> <p>Flick: we were the victim of the first of many thirst traps. this Thing insinuated itself into our group; i'm a little ashamed for not doing something sooner.</p> <p>Vaka: Flesiksa, someone over here is talking about thirst traps, isn't tha twhat your doctorate on?</p> <p>Flesika: Someone talking about thirst traps?</p> <p>Flick: thirst traps are when various strange creatures pose as a woman from someone's past in an attempt to entice them into acting against their interests. is that what you specialize in.</p> <p>Flesika: oh, no, I suppose the common term is Oasis, but it goes by many different names. you see, we're from the desert and oases are a subject of much contention.</p> <p>flick: so when you find above-ground pools in the desert, you call them thirst traps?</p> <p>flesiksa: that's right because they catch you because you are thirsty.</p> <p>vengeance: isn't that how the giant sandworms catch their prey?</p> <p>flesiksa: you've seen the sandworms?</p> <p>vengeance: yes, i know all about the dayama desert in the middle of the continent, i might add.</p> <p>flesiksa: you sound like you're reciting from some sort of tome. are you sure this is a natural area of knowledge for you?</p> <p>vengeance: yeah, it is , but i could always stand to learn more about it.</p> <p>flesiksa: you know, whatever humans do in the desert. a lot of lizard export. it's a pretty low economy sort of area. geographiacl exploration, and psychological exploration of time beyond geography that lends meaning to the land itself. is that what you mean?</p> <p>vengeance: saying &quot;you do what humans do&quot; is an odd way to phrase it.</p> <p>flesiksa: you're one to talk!</p> <p>desert exports: dankana -- old sanskrit word for borax(borax)</p> <ul><li><p>a flux for soldering and in the refining of metals and assaying of ores.</p></li> <li><p>in pottery glazes</p></li> <li><p>heat-resistant base</p></li> <li><p>preservative?</p></li> <li><p>mild base, so combat acidity</p></li></ul> <p>salt, salts,</p> <p>certain animal pelts</p> <p>vengeance: that's just the way i speak.</p> <p>flesiksa: your companions are humans, and they speak much more normally</p> <p>vengeance: i wondered if you knew anything about creatures called the Naga</p> <p>flick: these naga, do they have to eat people, vengeance?</p> <p>on &quot;naga&quot;, the three naga all react as though they weren't expecting that to be said.</p> <p>Flesiksa: the naga, yes, they are a mythological race, like centraurs, quite handsome, i'm told, they were in the myths, and thirst traps themselves, if i were to use your meaning of the phrase.</p> <p>flick now notices that the skirt extends in a kind of short train. under the pretext of taking another look at fez, she walks right behind flesiksa and steps on her tail. she feels that she makes contact with the tip of her tail. as she does so, she hears flesiksa hiss. the tail must be curled up under them compactly, at least while people are here. they are making an effort.</p> <p>hhhhhhhh โฆ you gotta watch that โฆ are you trying to flat-tire me? please be more careful, these tdresses take quite a while to weave.</p> <p>vengeance: we're not trying to step on any toes here. just hypothetically, if this were a โฆ Naga temple, would it be a temple to the god of <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Arogya.html">../../creatures/Arogya</a>, or [Kastari], the god of the forge and the kiln.</p> <p><a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/flesiksa.html">flesiksa</a>: well it's called the temple of kashtara, so โฆ</p> <p>vengeance: i guess it was the &quot;h&quot;</p> <p>flesiksa: some of those here have trouble with their &quot;s&quot;s</p> <p>vengeance: which one?</p> <p>flesiksa: well how versed are you in religious iconography?</p> <p>โฆ</p> <p>like Vaka told you, we're making renovations inside. this is just a temple we found. quite sturdy, too.</p> <p>we weren't the ones who carved the double-helix. but if that's on there, the temple is to that god.</p> <p>flick: do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're snake-people in the midst of a human town?</p> <p>f: do i find it hard to hide that there <em>are</em> snake people?</p> <p>flick: it's none of our business at the end of the day, but we would appreciate honesty, with our friend in your care , and what your <em>game</em> is.</p> <p><code>[intimidation nat 20]</code></p> <p>flesiksa looks a bit cowed. yes, our illusion here is not meant to be closely scrutinized. we primarmily receive those who can barely perceive the world around them. please, don't reveal our secreet. for some reason, the story that this is an old temple we found seems to carry water.</p> <p>flick: we don't want to make trouble. all we want to know is if we should be trusting you, and what you ahve to gain from taking in the sick folk.</p> <p>Vaka, in hearing range, comes over and puts a hand on flesiksa's side, &quot;it's ok, i've already told the unseemly monk what we are. his ventures into the city haven't resulted in any adverse press, so this is fully within what i've allowed</p> <p>Flesiksa: we want nothing more than to rehabilitate these creatures. it's just that โฆ this marsh sickness is unusual for us, coming from the desert, but what led us to take it on is that somehow the process they are going through mirrors that of the mummification rituals which the dead go through in our culture.</p> <p>flick: what brought you to this โฆ and please don't take this the wrong way โฆ so you're a bunch of sand-dwelling snake people</p> <p>vengeance: the manush.</p> <p>fles: yes, the manush. there are many naga, and we're just one self-identifying group</p> <p>flick: you're teh manush, who live in the desert, and ahve come to a place literally named after soggy grassland, and are posing as purveyors of medicine for a disease whose symptoms you recognize as a kind of mummification</p> <p>fles: well, this town is &quot;Sandford&quot; -- originally this was a Manush stronghold, it was one of the outposts of the empire when the desert extended here. the sandstone still exists, and you can see that the temple still stands.</p> <p>flick: this whole area used to be desert?</p> <p>fles: yes, it did.</p> <p>flick looks at the wall segments.</p> <p>fles: those walls are from after the desert reverted to decisuous land. no, those are build of fired brick and limestones or granite? this temple here extends at least its length again into the ground.</p> <p>flick: are you here to take your country back</p> <p>fles: that is impossible, for econolgical and religious reasons. but this is still a center of much power for us, so we maintain it that way, and when we can help the locals, we do so.</p> <p>[flick calc 21] - she's telling the truth about what she said.</p> <p>fles: the temple is considered a bit of a curiosity ehre, and we encourage that interpretation.</p> <p>flick: we're glad our friend is doing well, and we have an appointment to keep. we'll bid you a fond farewell.</p> <p>vengeance: one last thing. i wonder if our friend could use a quick prayer to arogya.</p> <p>vaka: are you suggested his new patron should be arogya?</p> <p>vengeance: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. yes.</p> <p>vaka: i've never heard of such a thing.</p> <p>vengeance: he told me if i was ever incapacitated i could make decisions for him.</p> <p>flick: no he didn't.</p> <p>vaka: i assume you can discuss that amongst you. it wouldn't be too late to just ask him when he recovers fully. but i don't know that it's been done before. a halfling -- who isn't more trustworthy than a little halfling to be an ambassador. there's i would hope no need to say this, but you won't speak poorly of us to the town, and we will make sure your friend recovers fully.</p> <p>vengeance: normally i trust all snakes and serpents.</p> <p>vaka: please don't call us snakes</p> <p>vengeance: there's something about this whole situation that doesn't seem right</p> <p>vaka: and from what i've heard from the nurses, noone thinks you seem right, so a sort of equilibrium has been attained</p> <p>vengeance: it takes one to know one</p> <p>vaka: that's pretty redundant to what i said</p> <p>flick: we're not here to break him out of prison</p> <p>vengeance: i was hoping to use my hawk-hatchet</p> <p>[for a moment, the conjunction of the idea of kashtari, teh god of the forge, and that with the idea of forging individualized magic weapons, occurs to you, but then disappears]</p> <p>vengeance: darn. you know โฆ when โฆ</p> <p>flick: it'll come back to you.</p> <p>vengeance: fine, if you just want to sleep and die!</p> <p>vengeance sinks down next to fez's cot and clasps his hands in his. dont worry little bud, we're going to get you out of here.</p> <p><code>[religion check]</code> as vengeance is grasping fez's hands, suddenly a brilliant voice and apiercing white light appears. I am <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Sustha.html">Sustha</a>. do you wish your friend's recovery. (Sustha is another patron saint of the recovering or the convalescent, she's reaching out to you, here. ) Sustha, where's Arogya? you're sending your lieutenants? i want to talk to the real deal!</p> <p>Sustha: Arogya has larger things to attend to. in case you haven't seen, there are dozens suffering from the sickness, here. your friend presents a special case: he is a halfling, and you wish him to recover, and he's lost his benefactor. if you tell him when he recovers that there is one waiting amongst the Manush, then that is all that I ask, and it's clear that you're willing to be a vessel of this kind, by how great your concern for the halfling is.</p> <p>vengeance: so โฆ what do i get?</p> <p>Sustha: a real mercenary perspective, I see. what is there to offer you? i can see in you a great well of healing potential. i can promise to increase that above its typical manifestation for you.</p> <p>vengeance: hmmm, nah. let's just let him die.</p> <p>Sustha: %% #plot-thread %% your friend will not be allowed to die, but the manner of his procession through life will still be up for claim. goodbye, vengeance, and look towards the brighter side of yourself, rather than the darker.</p> <p>vengeance: %% #plot-thread %% i'm still waiting to talk to Arogya. i'll get through one of these days.</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/hafdon/obsidian-general/edit/mac/marshbout/sessions/recaps/session_043_im_uhhhhh_pretty_good.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help improve the page?</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
