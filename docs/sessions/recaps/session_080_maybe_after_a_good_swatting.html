Somehow each one of these squicky monsters provided Flick with an unexpected sense of comradery; -- all except the one in the position until recently occupied by Jean-Luc, wherein appeared a metallic sphere about five feet across radiating a pink-white light and kept aloft by six large full-feathered swan wings, and onto which Flick's ire, and the apparent jeers of the insects, were directed.</p></details> <h2 id="recap"><a href="#recap" class="header-anchor">#</a> recap</h2> <p>Flick, still gripped by a hallucinatory madness, continues to unknowingly fighter friends; her adversary always taking the form of a body-swapping seraphim who has it out for her. Drav notices Ojorg giving off some odd heat, an impression which is reinforced later as he coughs up fire while recovering from spellcasting. Flick indulges her inner metaphor and goes invisible. Jaap tries his hand at diplomacy, but the psychological distance between his voice and the ranger's mind is too great. Drav temporarily traps Flick in an invisible Wall of Force bubble, and Ojorg further aggravates the hermeticized<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> elf by filling the upside-down bowl with noxious gas. In a moment of insight, Ojorg reproduces Drav's voice through Minor Illusion to calm Flick down, and the elf finally triumphs over the madness, though not before realizing that her feelings of friendship with the insects might be more than mere coincidence.</p> <p>Jaap notices an odd shadow in a moving light-sculpture by means of which Ojorg is recreating the battle. Though this deepens the gnome's mistrust of the newcomer, Pjorg takes the opposite approach and attempts (unsuccessfully) to begin to learn the art of light-sculpting. And as though lazing around after a fight weren't exciting enough, a transplanar crocodile giant shows up to demand it be given Flick.</p> <h2 id="transcript"><a href="#transcript" class="header-anchor">#</a> transcript</h2> <h3 id="chittering-abominations"><a href="#chittering-abominations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chittering abominations</h3> <p>Flick sees the weird insects but they are actually cheering her on. What she has to attack is the <a href="/marshbout/ontology/dhuno.html">Dhonu</a> or</p> <p>Flick's angry at the &quot;former&quot; Jean-Luc, because it seems as though his true nature is being revealed; she also strangely feels the same about the others (the insects), insofar as she doesn't know why they wouldn't have revealed their true selves before, in order to show they were her allies. —It's a long time to keep this up, <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Drav.html">Drav</a>, if that is your real name. She knocks an arrow and draws on Jean-Luc.</p> <p>They all notice, Drav perhaps just barely, that Flick is now pointing her arrow directly at Jean-Luc; no one else is in that line of attack. Flick then points her finger at the arrow, and then traces out the path of the arrow in the air at Jean-Luc. Then she points at Jean-Luc, points at her chest, as though it's an arrow sinking in, then back at Jean-Luc.</p> <p>Drav's attention is mostly captured by the intense heat which <a href="/marshbout/creatures/ojorg_sweetleaf.html">Ojorg</a> continues to emit. <a href="/marshbout/creatures/jaap_jansen.html">Jaap</a> and <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Pjorg.html">Pjörg</a> intuit that this bellicosity must originate from Flick's recent proximity to <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Gargan.html">Gargan</a>, perhaps even calculating that touching the <a href="/marshbout/items/twinning_fork.html">twinning fork</a> had something to do with it. Jaap, having cast Dispel Magic on Jean-Luc not moments ago, feels confident in this hypothesis.</p> <p>For Pjorg, the <em>Small Ones</em> are always fickle and unpredictable; their ways can't be known in the same way one can't know which way an insect is going to fly. It's possible that <a href="/marshbout/creatures/species/goliaths.html">goliaths</a> even see a bit more &quot;slowly&quot; than smaller creatures. Maybe. Also, unless picked up and examined closely, it's assumed that smaller creatures have compound eyes.</p> <p>He has also been engaged in fiddling with the chalkboard. It's not super out-of-the-ordinary for a Small One to act this way; —Here we go again, he thinks to himself.</p> <h3 id="gnome-luck"><a href="#gnome-luck" class="header-anchor">#</a> Gnome luck</h3> <p>Jaap has just seen all of this in Jean-Luc, and his former tactic worked pretty well, so again he attempts <code>Dispel Magic</code>. Unfortunately, perhaps due to the greater amount of time Flick was in contact with the wand, the spell fails. Jaap knows this immediately, He prepares himself to push Jean-Luc out of the way should Flick fire at him. Jaap has seen that Flick is well able to hit creatures with her arrows who are almost entirely out of sight, but he nevertheless bravely runs in front of the rogue, hoping that Flick won't attempt a shot if one of her friends is between her and the target. —Flick, no, what are you doing? Jaap calls out.</p> <p>You're helping him now, are you? She shouts back at Insect-Jaap who, passing in front of the Dhonu, is pulled back, and the Dhonu, a cold steel globe, full wings flapping menacingly, remains the foremost creature.</p> <h3 id="madness-made-invisible"><a href="#madness-made-invisible" class="header-anchor">#</a> Madness made invisible</h3> <p>Somehow Flick hears Jaap's real voice through the interference of the madness, which she is briefly able to see past. She grapples internally with continuing to attack what could very well be her friends, a conflict which stupefies her enough to allow her to not attack. Her vision is even confused enough that she can't quite tell if the flying orb or dripping insect &quot;pal&quot; is in front.</p> <p>Still do it! Pjorg stage-whispers from the wings.</p> <p>Flick shakes her head vigorously, and can't understand why -- a second ago this bug creature wanted this hideous <a href="/marshbout/ontology/seraphim.html">seraphim</a>-type-thing dead, but now it's walking in front of it? -- she knows she's a pretty good shot but she's not going to take that chance. Instead, she bolts ten yards away from the creature, spins to face them again, jumps into the air, and tosses out dried leaves, which, as they leave her hands (as they do so taking on the characteristics of some of the vegetation on Si'a, such as perfectly circular blue leaves which rotate and create a distracting pattern of sparkles) and form a freestanding curtain in the air; when they fall, <strong>she's no longer visible.</strong></p> <h3 id="the-hero-they-deserve"><a href="#the-hero-they-deserve" class="header-anchor">#</a> The hero they deserve</h3> <p>Jean-Luc realizes that discretion is the better part of valor, shouts —Peace out! and runs back to the ruins of the library, and hides. Flick sees one of the insects leave to take cover, and a weird geometric spacetime folding happens, and the celestial object tracks her movements as Flick ran backwards, and now she sees it just off to the right of where she was before. —Oh that's the game we're playing now, is it? Flick taunts, not knowing exactly what game that is.</p> <p>Startrella is likewise confused —Everyone, do you know what's happening with Flick right now? Is this a game you play after defeating an enemy? Does Flick have to work out her excess energy like a dog just taken on a walk?</p> <p>Something like that, Jaap offers.</p> <p>Well, Small One, Pjorg says, addressing Startrella, as you know, those of your size are mercurial in nature, and I believe this to be another one of the miniscule irrationalities. They usually work this out of their system, maybe after a good swatting.</p> <p>Should I try to &quot;incapacitate&quot; her, per se, Startrella asks.</p> <p>I think that would be great fun, Pjorg answers. Don't take too long with that tiny brain.</p> <p>Pjorg and Startrella determine through collaborative dialog that small creatures &quot;react&quot; faster but &quot;explore all the logical possibilities&quot; slower.</p> <p>Ok I'm gonna sprint at her, then, and get in her face. And Startrella rushes over to Flick's location just as the ranger disappears behind the portière of leaves. Flick sees the winged orb approach at speed and flap its wings annoyingly to beat the leaves away. She barely keeps from shouting out,  tightens her grip on her bow, and reaches for another arrow.</p> <p>I've definitely seen this before -- some kind of possession, although I myself certainly don't have any personal acquaintance with being possessed, but looks like a kind of madness, but … can anyone see her? Ojorg begins to cross the ground tactically in an attempt to hem the ranger in.</p> <p>Pjorg sighs extremely heavily, takes up a position behind his shield, and readies a hand-axe to knock an arrow out of the air mid-flight should he see one, knowing full well that he probably can't do it. This will pass, he thinks tiredly to himself, rolling his eyes.</p> <h3 id="all-magic-is-dangerous"><a href="#all-magic-is-dangerous" class="header-anchor">#</a> All magic is dangerous</h3> <p>Drav moves closer to Jaap cautiously and conspiratorially. —Hey, what's going on here?</p> <p>Jaap explains that some force is exerting an influence over Flick.</p> <p>— Hold on, where did she go? Is Startrella doing some kind of dance over there? Drav asks.</p> <p>Ojorg, hearing this now after Jaap's loud answer — She disappeared after throwing some <a href="/marshbout/items/kimbok_tree.html">kimbok leaves</a> in the air. I can't tell exactly if it's where Startrella made it to.</p> <p>Drav prepares a spell to evoke should Flick reappear.</p> <p>— It seems like Flick might be con&quot;flick&quot;ted about what's happening; she had an arrow ready to go and blipped without firing it, Ojorg says.</p> <p>— It's not a dangerous spell, Drav reassures everyone.</p> <p>— All magic is dangerous, Pjorg avuncularly reminds them.</p> <h3 id="i-see-right-through-your-attempt-at-peaceful-interaction"><a href="#i-see-right-through-your-attempt-at-peaceful-interaction" class="header-anchor">#</a> I see right through your attempt at peaceful interaction!</h3> <p>Jaap moves slowly and surely, hands empty and out at his sides, towards Flick's last known position. When he last spoke to Flick, he remembers, she heeded his plea for a ceasefire. — It's us, why would you want to attack us?</p> <p>Somehow this only calcifies Flick's madness, making it more dominant and strengthening it, especially with the celestial sphere still up in her face. Instead of helping me, he entreats me on behalf of this annoying creature, she thinks.</p> <p>Jaap positions himself behind his shield, hoping his placatory words had some effect.</p> <h3 id="an-intimate-subspace-bond"><a href="#an-intimate-subspace-bond" class="header-anchor">#</a> An intimate subspace bond</h3> <p>Flick, popping back into vision, channels the heightened <em>uppgangr</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> into forming an intimate subspace bond with the hideous creature which doesn't know quite where she is. She teleports backwards ten feet, &quot;planar warriors it,&quot; taking her time with an arrow, misses Startrella (who to Flick is a dhuno), as Drav siphons some of the same planar energies to encase the elven ranger in a hemispherical Wall of Force.</p> <p>Flick is aware that Drav cast something, but she doesn't know what, and certainly doesn't know it's a Wall of Force exactly ten feet away from her in every direction. She instinctively teleports, but only a short distance, remaining within the Wall. She fires an arrow, and it bounces off an invisible surface, and the pieces start to come together. Her ranger senses don't pick up the echoic vibrations of the hemisphere well enough to determine what shape the Wall might take; in frustration she screams &quot;soprano screams&quot; against <a href="/marshbout/creatures/norvorian.html">the God of Obstacles: Norvorian</a></p> <p>To Pjorg it sounds like someone shouting from the other side of a pane of glass; the party's ears are consequently saved from damage to their cilia caused by high frequencies.</p> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>mechanics</summary> <p>Flick's &quot;invis-ability&quot; can be used at the beginning of a turn (as a bonus action) and allow her to act invisibly for her entire turn.</p></details> <p>— You're lucky it took me a bit to find you, or I'd have grappled you to the ground by now, says Startrella, approaching Flick. Luckily the starchild pulls up just shy of the invisible wall, of which presence she is only mildly aware. To Flick, though, (as Startrella passed by others) the dhuno shivers and slinks to another bug from its previous occupant, glides up to her, and emits the preceding words in Startrella's loungy voice. The juxtaposition between the two sets the ranger off again.</p> <p>— Oh yeah, why don't you try, with your <a href="/marshbout/language/turr-shit.html">turr-shit</a> wings, you turr-head. Try grappling me without any thumbs, you piece of turr-shit!</p> <p>— I'm just trying to keep you from hurting anyone, <em>m'<a href="/marshbout/creatures/Glob.html">glob</a></em>. Flick hears &quot;hurting&quot; in a distorted celestial bass and gets even more defensive-aggressive.</p> <h3 id="slurp-slurp-plurp"><a href="#slurp-slurp-plurp" class="header-anchor">#</a> Slurp, slurp. Plurp.</h3> <p>— How resistant to poisons is your wild friend there? Ojorg has stomped over to Pjorg.</p> <p>— I assume … not, Pjorg responds.</p> <p>— I suppose that's acceptable. You have some healers amongst you in case anything bad happens? You could restore her to life. Consciousness. I meant consciousness, Ojorg scrambles.</p> <p>— I don't … care.</p> <p>— Oh <a href="/marshbout/factions/bish_bash_bosh.html">bosh</a>, I should be asking someone else, shouldn't I?</p> <p>— Probably.</p> <p>— Well, no matter. The <em>unquod</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> dwarf produces a rotten egg from his robes, crushes it between his palms, slurps up the yolk, and then spews out cloud of greenish, sulfuric cloud which, through the magic of &quot;flavor not following the mechanics&quot; penetrates the Wall and settles on Flick like a pot of pea soup poured on a cat.</p> <h3 id="in-which-the-dm-offends-michael"><a href="#in-which-the-dm-offends-michael" class="header-anchor">#</a> In which the DM offends Michael.</h3> <p>Flick is &quot;Dutch-ovened in the best way possible&quot;. Due to the hot-box, Flick, with her sensitive stomach, begins to retch uncontrollably. The stuffy space of this upside-down bowl holds the gas in, so there is no hope it will dissipate soon.</p> <p>— That ended up a bit denser than I thought it would. You think it'll be ok?</p> <p>— Almost certainly, Pjorg offers, already distracted. Seeing this particular situation, the fighter yells to Flick — Small one, what does it smell like?</p> <p>He hears, as if shouted through water, what she thinks is one of the insects say &quot;small one&quot;; however, her continuous vomiting prevents any epiphany.</p> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>mechanics</summary> <p>Wall of Force doesn't block any teleportation. Ian rethinks flavoring Flick's teleportation as traveling through the planes.</p></details> <p>Drav sees Flick retching in the Dutch Oven, and walks over with a bewildered expression — Are you ok? she asks incredibly tentatively. A little too tentatively and quietly, as it turns out. Flick notices that groups of three are beginning to form among the insects, and it brings to mind her encounters with the <a href="/marshbout/factions/three_school.html">threeschools</a>. The insect who cast the Wall of Force is the one that's come closest.</p> <p>Are they some kind of fifth column? Is there anyone I can trust? Flick thinks, trapped inside the goldfish bowl.</p> <p>Drav prepares again to loose some elemental energy if this lonely, nauseated, confused elf should try anything nasty.</p> <p>Jaap, confident in his knowledge that Drav and Ojorg cast Wall of Force (form of: hemisphere!) and Stinking Cloud, respectively, concludes that Flick is entirely encased and may be suffering ill effects. He joins the group from his relatively distant position. — Hey, Flick, are you doing alright there? His reassuring tone, registering as background chittering, doesn't break through Flick's gastrointestinal distress. However, this oddly sympathetic insect hasn't joined the coven or tried to attack.</p> <p>Incidentally, in her reeling and projectile vomiting, she creates a few Jackson Poll-Flick paintings on the wall of the invisible hemisphere, which gives her the contours of the prison. Man, I've gotta get out of this place, she whispers to herself, and Mistysteps out in the direction she was facing, seeing the Seraphim/Startrella through the <code>lightly obstructing</code> haze of the spell effects and toddling, still clutching her stomach, to the opposite side of the sphere.</p> <p>The Jaap/Insect peels some congealed milk off its body and slurps the curds up through a proboscis.</p> <p>— You gotta go around the wall, baby! Flick taunts Startrella/dhuno, which appears to roll itself up and over the dome, coming to rest just shy of the ranger, as its threatening and incompetent demeanor dictates. (The wings flutter like the paws of a cat trying to cling onto a slippery countertop, while the deeply unsettling static remains the same volume no matter how far away it is.)</p> <p>Ojorg, his cloud evaded — I can't believe she got out of that, he mumbles, thinks for a moment, and, hoping to bypass the madness, casts Minor Illusion to replay the sound of Drav's voice asking if Flick is ok, supplementing that with — Why are you attacking us? and offering her a bowl of noodles (Ojorg is concentrating really hard).</p> <p>Suddenly Flick remembers that Drav exists, as it were, and is finally able to hold at bay these mental distortions. The dhuno resolves into Startrella, coming at Flick for a midsection takedown, and sees her friends come into focus as well, and she's momentarily free of the vision.</p> <p>— I think that should do the trick. Drav, I hope you don't think of it as a betrayal but I used your voice (as a ventriloquist might; I myself am an amateur ventriloquist), to ask if she was ok and remind her she had friends, in order to try to draw her from her fit, says Ojorg.</p> <p>— Can you explain the process of learning ventriloquism to me, Small One?</p> <p>— Sure, sure. First you have to get a sending stone, and make sure your friend has a sending stone, then call your friend on the sending stone and then you don't have to use a dummy at this point since they can't see you, but you get a glass of water and you're talking to your friend and you drink the glass of water and if your friend thinks that you're still talking then that's the first step. That's how I was taught.</p> <p>— Understandable.</p> <p>— Great. Great great great great great.</p> <p>— You know what, whatever works, Drav says, patting Ojorg on the shoulder.</p> <p>— Thanks for you retroactive permission. Of course, this is just a cantrip so I could cast it again. It should help in remedying her condition until she's past the dangerous point. I think everyone should support her now while she's free of whatever she was experiencing.</p> <h3 id="expertly-and-artfully-using-a-chalkboard"><a href="#expertly-and-artfully-using-a-chalkboard" class="header-anchor">#</a> Expertly and artfully using a chalkboard</h3> <p>At this, Pjorg turns back to his chalkboard. Given the unassuming size of the object and his blocky handwriting, he's only able to inscribe a handful of runes on it at once with the chalk. Even with his experimentation so restricted, though, he finds that as he sketches out the symbols he's experiencing possible alternatives for ways to extend what he's written, including runes he has no experience with. He draws the first half of the Cloud Rune. (Typically, when he invokes this rune, it feels like when you're grappling with a hard problem, and the multiple things you know about it coalesce and you know the answer in a kind of Eureka moment.) This same sudden feeling manifests in his hand as he draws out the rune, but it seems as though it's been done without the effort it usually takes to get to that spark of insight. Pjorg makes a note of all this.</p> <h3 id="maybe-put-some-gloves-on-next-time"><a href="#maybe-put-some-gloves-on-next-time" class="header-anchor">#</a> Maybe put some gloves on next time</h3> <p>— What caused this madness in the first place? Did anyone see? asks Drav.</p> <p>— I think it was that wand that Gargan had; something happened when Jean-Luc touched it as well, Jaap says.</p> <p>— Can we get it away? Jean-Luc isn't affected anymore.</p> <p>— It's in the bag of holding, Flick says, so I don't know if we should touch it.</p> <p>— Maybe put gloves on next time, Jaap says.</p> <p>Jean-Luc slinks out from behind some girders, looking as though he'd been knuckle-rolling a coin and updating his real-estate licensing forms.</p> <p>— The ownership of property is thievery, Pjorg whispers. Anarchism.</p> <h3 id="cured-for-now"><a href="#cured-for-now" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cured for now</h3> <p>Jaap believes shielding Flick's mind in this moment of calm would be wise, but doesn't have anything of that caliber in his magical armory. However, as Flick begins to feel a compulsion overtake her again, she whispers a refrain from a lullaby she was sung by her first parents long after a child would need to be about love being the cradle of the world, which keeps her rooted (<code>Protection from Evil</code>). She feels the spectral palimpsest recede to the edge of her awareness, and are finally expelled completely by the lullaby-spell.</p> <p>Flick leans backwards, allowing the curve of the Wall to take her weight. — I'm not sorry I missed, that time, she says, thinking of the harm that might have befallen her friends had she not been off her game. <code>Nat 20 CHA saving throw.</code> While the experience is fresh in her mind, she alights on the realization that the power of the madness hooked onto her subconscious value systems, and that the insects, which in her state she considered allies, may be in some way sympathetic, and that celestials inimical. This realization is dissonant to her past education, but she doesn't dismiss it out of hand.</p> <p>Napkins and papyrii come flying out of the bag as the elf searches for a blank &quot;page&quot; in her &quot;journal&quot;; finding one, she inscribes onto it: <em>Angels = Bad guys??</em></p> <p>Well after it would have felt natural, Startrella hug-grapples Flick. — You're not going to try to hurt us again, right? How tightly should I be hugging you?</p> <p>— This is just about right, Flick confirms.</p> <p>— We'll get you riz tuts<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>, don't you worry.</p> <p>— Don't make promises you can't keep, Startrella; but I think I'm ok for now.</p> <p>Jaap associates the failure of the Dispel Magic with the absence of the Farmer Aspect.</p> <p>Drav begins to poke at her spell scroll. The others, though, notice that after Ojorg, having emitted the stinking cloud, suffered something of an asthma attack, and with each breath a little fire escaped from his mouth.</p> <p>Is he a secret dragon? Flick hopes.</p> <p>Who knows why small things do the things they do, Pjorg thinks.</p> <p>Drav now remembers a practical technique that, given enough time, would allow her to unroll the scroll without damaging it. She sighs and hangs it back on her quarterstaff.</p> <p>Trying to make sense of the last minute, she wonders how the hullabaloo got started and pulls out the ring again. Should I? she wonders, mentally drawing out the last syllable. The ring goes back in her pocket, again absent of feelings of fate. It's all the same fiendish turrshit at the end of the day.</p> <h3 id="suspicions"><a href="#suspicions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Suspicions</h3> <p>— I guess with the Library … gone … we should head to <a href="/marshbout/creatures/pilzzt.html">Pilzzt</a>'s house with the knowledge we have? I'm guessing the <a href="/marshbout/creatures/species/spaceshark.html">sharks</a> are still there.</p> <p>— Didn't you have a friend curating the library? What happened to them?</p> <p>— It's hard to tell definitively. I'm pretty sure they weren't part of that … thing. And I may have oversold her before; she is, or was, more like a clerk than a librarian. So I'm not sure where she is now: maybe she's at another library, or Glob forbid was consumed by that creature.</p> <p>Flick's having a hard time piecing together where to even backtrack to. Sia's been one bizarre aberration after another, and it's not clear to her that Startrella has their best interests at heart. In fact, maybe she's been leading them into all these traps. As a result, she's disinclined to go along with the starchild's suggestions and perhaps displays that inner intractability and resistance on her face.</p> <p>Jaap sticks a suspicious eye on Ojorg, and sees that once the dwarf has gotten back his breath the ignited gasps cease. Otherwise no <strong>demon</strong>strable signs of abnormality appear.</p> <p>Until, that is, he adopts the posture of some of the artists in the <a href="/marshbout/ontology/polariton.html">polariton</a> and light-sculpts. The gang recognizes his expertise immediately as he recreates the scene which just took place, starting from Flick's unthinking grasp of the wand, through the battle, with each of the participants depicted. And it looks more like a calming doodling for him.</p> <p>He's not attempting to hide anything, but what they'd thought was a smudge, or the different palette he's using (they can't place how, but his process looks qualitatively different from the starchildren they saw) , capturing a blurry image on the furthest edges of the flickering sculpture, a portentous bulk hovering as a satellite.</p> <p>It raises the hackles of Jaap and Pjorg; clearly Ojorg has artistic, perhaps subconscious access to whatever this is, invisible to the naked eye.</p> <p>— Does anyone have any idea what this is? Jaap, approaching the sculpture, draws their attention to the miniature shadow. Ojorg, in somewhat of a meditative state, turns to face Jaap and as he does so, the figure, which, if it were mapped onto the land, would have been behind the blue dwarf when he was facing away, disappears.</p> <p>— I'm sorry, what are you pointing at?</p> <p>— It was right here, where did it go?</p> <p>— Sometimes there are echoes, &quot;artifacts&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>, &quot;latents&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>, or &quot;accidents&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> with me, which I like to attribute to my exotic origin compared to the starchildren. Sometimes spots or blurs will appear, especially if it's behind me, since I have to keep most of the sculpture in the &quot;signing space&quot; (if you've ever used YSL<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>)</p> <p>Jaap is even more mistrustful now that this one point, which was quite eerie, would disappear, and that there were none other of these blurs in the sculpture. The gnome feels like Ojorg is probably telling the truth; there's a slim chance that he knows what they might be talking about, but he was actually surprised to hear that something appeared behind him.</p> <p>Drav is waiting until her friends make a little distance from Ojorg before she tells them about the warm spot on his back.</p> <h3 id="pjorg-proves-himself-a-savant-at-light-sculpting"><a href="#pjorg-proves-himself-a-savant-at-light-sculpting" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pjorg proves himself a savant at light-sculpting</h3> <p>Pjorg, looking at the light sculpture, and imagining how cool it would be to create Runes that way, wonders how long it would take him to learn. Given that Startrella mentioned the necessity of an innate predisposition, and his obvious possession of that talen he estimates a fast apprenticeship.</p> <p>— Hey, can we take five and you can show me how to do that?</p> <p>— Oh, sure, well, I was using a few techniques, are you talking about anything specific?</p> <p>— Maybe start with one and do the rest.</p> <p>Ojorg looks around. — Does anybody mind this? Are you in a hurry to go somewhere?</p> <p>— It could take six minutes, Pjorg reassures him.</p> <p>— I mean, this is a lifelong endeavor. We could probably assess some of your natural talents in six minutes.</p> <p>— Mmm. I think I'll get it.</p> <p>— Ohh kay, Ojorg drawls, dubiously. He walks over to stand in front of Pjorg, the top of his head level with Pjorg's knees. He reaches up to touch the back of Pjorg's thigh just under the curve of his butt. Pjorg can feel his energy, or charisma, or some kind of force, flowing into him; it feels sensual and invigorating. — Try to do what I do. He draws, with his fingertip, a straight line, from the height of his eyes to his waist.</p> <p>Pjorg takes his own hand, places it in the symmetrical position on Ojorg, and goes to draw a line in the air.</p> <p>— That's very pleasant, but unnecessary. The hand placement is largely for me to get a better feel for your abilities.</p> <p>Pjorg leaves his hand where it is. Ojorg is clearly trying to hold out on the secrets already.</p> <p>— Ok, a little awkward for you, bending down like that. Oops, well, ok, shrinking now. The dwarf's hand now rests on Pjorg's shoulder.</p> <p>Pjorg reaches his hand out, and can feel Ojorg trying to push the energy through him, as though he's a sausage casing; the energy comes up to what feels like his forearm, at which point it stalls, and nothing emerges from the goblin's finger. — Ah, I've already mastered the art of invisible light sculpting. I told you I was a quick study.</p> <p>— If that's true, this would really be an event to be celebrated. Ojorg reaches his hand out and passes it through the air where the line would be, encountering no resistance. — I don't think that's the case though.</p> <p>— A cake, bring a cake! Pjorg says to Drav. — Clearly an event to be celebrated!</p> <p>— I'm never gonna deny a cake, that's for sure.</p> <p>— Jaap, Ojorg wants a cake too.</p> <p>— Are we just talkin' cake now? Yeah, I'll take a cake.</p> <p>As Pjorg thinks they are engaged in whipping up some cake, he leans over and stage-whispers to Ojorg — Let's try again.</p> <h3 id="deblurring"><a href="#deblurring" class="header-anchor">#</a> Deblurring</h3> <p>At that moment, they all detect a powerful electronic burst coming from behind the library in the equivalent position of the light-sculpture blur. In that space they see a creature …</p> <p>— I did it! Pjorg cries.</p> <p>… the likes of which they've never encountered. About twice as tall as a human, it resembles a bulky mantis with the head of an alligator, harsh blue light streaming from between every exoskeletal plate. A crest of foot-long spines runs along its back from its head to its pelvis, and two thick arms from which emerge apparently random protuberances of bone or gristle, all dripping with some viscous alien fluid. As they stand there, it says, in a deep rumble, — <strong>Give me the Walker</strong>, and stares at Flick.</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div> <hr class="footnotes-sep"> <section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p><strong>hermeticized, adj</strong> Hermetically sealed (in). <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li> <li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p><strong>uppgangr, n</strong>.
