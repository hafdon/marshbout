They estimate that she also doesn't have access to her powers. Various of them are feeling the effects of <a href="/marshbout/ontology/rapid_magical_diminution.html">rapid magical diminution</a>. Luckily <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Flick.html">Flick</a> had just tossed the <a href="/marshbout/items/bag_of_holding.html">bag of holding</a> out the window where its contents violently explodes outwards as its preternatural commodiousness fades away.</p> <p>Flick leaps out the window down onto the rocky hill in order to refill the bag as quickly as she can. Some of the vials have smashed and broken on the rough terrain, but a fair amount are in a recoverable state. The <a href="/marshbout/creatures/species/elf.html">elf</a> gazes out at the surrounding countryside, looking for signs of a natural or metaphysical storm. Despite her confidence, and darkvision, she is still only able to see so far at night. Many of the windows in the house being broken, though, does allow a soft carpet of domestic light to permeate the house's curtain.</p> <p>The <a href="/marshbout/sessions/recaps/aura.html">aura</a> moves with <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Jean-Luc.html">Jean-Luc-Bear</a>. <a href="/marshbout/creatures/jaap_jansen.html">Jaap</a> walks up to the pile of debris in a bid to unbury <a href="/marshbout/creatures/vengeance.html">Vengeance</a> while Jean-Luc-Bear stares pointedly in the other direction, still miffed about certain insulting comments made by the monk.</p> <p>Vengeance: Look at this Jean-Luc-Bear glowing like it's his birthday. Who do you think you are, JLB? (Today is JLB's birthday, and with that comment it comes across that Vengeance knows this.)</p> <p>JLB reaches his paw out reactively, and a &quot;glittering&quot; <a href="/marshbout/mechanics/garls_inspiration_coins.html">Golden Coin</a> drops into it. He sees that on the front of the coin is depicted a smiling, ruddy-faced gnome with a long handlebar mustache and impossibly twinlking eyes. On the reverse, intricately incised woodland creatures dance around the circumference, circling a symbol in the center which, at least to one literate in <a href="/marshbout/language/common.html">Common</a> orthography, resembles a P with a dot over it. JLB wracks his brains for a language or protolanguage this might remind him of; he's heard mention of thieves finding such coins mixed incongruously into ancient treasure hordes. Some urban legends have the coins appearing spontaneously in the coinpurses of those who do an especially good (or bad) deed.</p> <p>Jean-Luc-Bear looks for a pocket, but his clothing has merged into his bear form; nevertheless this provides him with a pretext to continue to ignore Vengeance. Flick finds it difficult to get back into the room with her fancy stolen gloves having lost their arcane tackiness. JLB walks over to see if proximity to his aura will change anything for the ranger. They both notice that Flick's ears perk back up, and the elf suddenly feels light on her feet and a tingle coming from the gloves. She gives the stinky werebear a big hug, her head barely achieving the armpits.</p> <h3 id="feelizing"><a href="#feelizing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Feelizing</h3> <p>She immediately begins feelizing<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> the radius of the aura and determines it extends only slightly past his reach. โYou go your entire life not knowing what you could be missing.</p> <p>Is anyone going to help these guys out of the rubble? Without waiting for a (no doubt lackadaisical) response Drav stomps over and with the help of Jaap catapult Vengeance from his prison of rammel.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> He splays out on the ground, robe covered in a chunky patina of dust and rocks, the occasional tiny crystal or piece of mica sparkling as it catches the firelight from the nearby brazier. Some dust kicked up by the excavation settles into the bowl of what is now non-ritual water.</p> <p>Thank you both, I thought I was done for there. To be honest it was kind of a nice feeling, but I guess now that I'm still alive I might as well go on. Vengeance stumbles half-heartedly in the direction of JLB, who continues to ignore him. โJean-Luc-Bear I don't think you understand. We saved the day, with our puppetry. You asked me to puppet you and I did. We brought down the house, man. Literally.</p> <p>In a rare moment of conciliation JLB walks over to the monk and gives him a literal bearhug; he can feel Vengeance pushing his face deep into the fur and inhales deeply the musky oder like a true weirdo. As Vengeance does so, he feels each of his chakra points light up, especially the one nearest his groin. โJean-Luc, you found the Secret Meridian. I've been looking for this my whole life.</p> <p>Jaap has now had a few moments to survey the goings-on, enough to gather that JLB offers a temporary proxy for access to the <a href="/marshbout/locations/ys.html">Ys</a>'s magic.</p> <p>They all suddenly realize that, since the lights flickered, heralding the dissipation of magic, the sounds of the storm outside had similarly calmed. โDid we, uh, get <a href="/marshbout/creatures/pelageena_vernix.html">Pelageena</a> out? Drav looks around concernedly. โI left her where she was, Flick says. โWell we should certainly keep here away from Jean-Luc Bear, Drav says.</p> <h3 id="a-deal-with-gina"><a href="#a-deal-with-gina" class="header-anchor">#</a> A deal with Gina</h3> <p>The mighty dwarven wizard steps cautiously over to where she can see Pelageena squashed under the rubble, burried almost up to the shoulders, hands presumably trapped against her sides. โYou may as well just โฆ leave me here. There's been too much time without magic, now, for me to restart the ritual. I'd have to try it from somewhere else, but <a href="/marshbout/creatures/valeryl_vernix.html">mother</a>'s made that virtually (by which I mean magically) impossible.</p> <p>We're not going to let you go that easily, ma'am. I'm afraid you'll have to come with us and try to fix this thing, says Flick.</p> <p>Fix it how?</p> <p>You're the one who brought about this cataclysm, so I was envisioning making you figure it out.</p> <p>I suppose that's fair, in a way, Pelageena says. Lets hoist me out of here. She struggles to extend a hand. Flick is still deeply suspicious, and witholds aid until she can reflect for a second. Drav sees, now that she's closer, that Pelageena, who already resembled a <a href="/marshbout/factions/moonlight_sorcery.html">moonlight sorceress</a>, is turning completely transparent, so much so that the shape of the rocks behind her can be seen through her flesh. She's fading out.</p> <p>Flick and Drav her two extended arms and pull the still corporeal woman over the piles of rubble into the dining room. Flicks feet crunch on the goblinoid skulls (identifiable in part to the ranger through diacritical<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> marks such as fangs) which adorn the floor. It brings to mind what she knows about the <a href="/marshbout/chronology/history/goblin_disappearance.html">disappearance of the goblins</a>.</p> <p>notion amongst commoners that there hadn't been goblins seen in a long time; never all that common, but absence was noticed over the last few decades. (like if someone noticed there were fewer pigeons in london -- &quot;not really a bad ting&quot;) or like in our world how kids don't know how few animals. Flick, &quot;when I was 10, a ton of goblins, I haven't s'een any in 20 years.&quot;</p> <p>She's not an anthropologist, but given what she saw around the blob in the tower she has her suspicions. With all attempts at respect she picks her way out from the skull fragments. โWhat possessed you to do all this? Why did you turn your house into this charnel den? What could possibly have been worth this?</p> <p>My freedom, Pelageena replies. It was one of the only ways for me to break my mother's restraints on where my sister and I are allowed to be.</p> <p>Flick lets the conversation drop at that.</p> <h3 id="little-dlek"><a href="#little-dlek" class="header-anchor">#</a> Little Dlek</h3> <p>They all see, poking his head in past <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Pjorg.html">Pjorg</a>, a <a href="/marshbout/creatures/little_brother_dlek.html">boy</a>, perhaps 8 or 9 years old if human, with the striking attribute of a body divided into three approximately equal width sections, each running from his toes to his head. His leftmost side is a dark lavender color, much like the drow or the duergar, the center is a rich clay-red, and the rightmost side is the yellow-green of a swamp at daybreak. He seems ignorant of everyone but Pelageena. โHey, did you know that all the lights are out upstairs?</p> <p>Yes, I'm sorry, there's probably quite a lot that's not working right now. I'm afraid these newcomers here have, well, to be plain, they've destroyed all the magic on the estate, and I don't know how far out it extends, says Pelageena in response.</p> <p>The boy, who was either sleeping or drifting off while reading, rubs his eyes sleepily. โCan I grab one of these torches, then? I don't know where mom keeps all the candles.</p> <p>Yeah, take what you need. What were you reading?</p> <p>Oh, some play. I can't even remember the characters, I was mostly just daydreaming. Having gotten his bearings, he looks around the room more attentively. โCan I โฆ what's, uh โฆ do you need any help here?</p> <p>I'm really not sure you'd be any help here. But โฆ have you checked to see if your powers are working? He looks down at his hands and flexes his fingers, as though expecting a gauche display of crackling energy to zap down his forearms. Nothing happens.</p> <p>Huh, how bout that. Well, can I make anyone a sandwich or anything? Is anyone hungry?</p> <p>Yeah, I could eat, says Flick. JLB grunts in the affirmative.</p> <p>What was the play that you were reading? I was actually trying to remember some lines from <a href="/marshbout/items/Ten-Axe_kills_the_witch.html">Ten-Axe kills the witch, a play</a></p> <p>Yeah, we do have that upstairs, I can go grab it for you. It's not what I was reading though.</p> <p>What were you reading, Vengeance asks.</p> <p>It's more of a &quot;social manners&quot; play, like <a href="/marshbout/items/godolstian_and_the_house_of_rue.html">godolstian_and_the_house_of_rue</a>, it's one of those &quot;comedies of manners&quot;. Pretty droll.</p> <p>Very droll! Vengeance confirms.</p> <p>It's probably why I fell asleep reading it. Do you want to come up and see the library?</p> <p>I would love to, the monk pontificates. โI have this memory and it might have been a dream of seeing this terrible black star outside somewhere, and โฆ was that real?</p> <p>Terrible black star, the boy repeats. โYou mean in the night sky?</p> <p>No, it was here, nearby somewhere. Extremely ominous. Vengeance trails off.</p> <p>Oh yeah you're probably talking about the meteorite. He turns to his sister. โIs that what he's talking about?</p> <p>Yes. Yep. That's it, Pelageena confirms.</p> <p>Pelageena confirms to Vengeance that she is not, in fact, Tishara.</p> <p>So if <em>you're</em> not Tishara, Vengeance considers, I think I'm in the wrong place right now.</p> <p>Well, are you more at home in the library, or perhaps on the stage, you seem like you have something theatrical about yourself. Oh, and I just remembered what I was reading. It's <em><a href="/marshbout/items/fomblitudes_of_manlius_and_yudas.html">The Fomblitudes of Manlius and Yudas</a></em> Definitely the title of a comedy of manners if I've ever heard one.</p> <p>So many great fomblitudes in that one, Vengeance laughs. Sure, I guess while we're here might as well take the tour.</p> <p>I know there's some simple antepasto I could set out. How much of the ground floor have you seen? asks the boy. When I walked past the front door that looked like โฆ it's probably where you came in.</p> <p>Everyone except Drav and Vengeance notice that his well-defined neopolitan-ice-cream color bars bleed into one another and become muddier such that the overlapping flesh is a dark brown, almost as though he's a paint palette and the paint is mixing.</p> <p>JLB approaches the boy to smell him to see if he smells familliar in any way, or smells like an otherworldly apparition. He does not smell like a creature, or an animal, or a humanoid. The werebear shakes his head and backs awy, hoping to convey his impression through that simple pantomime.</p> <p>Flick, given her inborn sympathy with creatures of the forest, intuits JLB's meaning, and comes up to Vengeance. โMaybe we should all go on this &quot;tour&quot; together.</p> <p>Dlek walks into the adjoining room, starts pulling cheeses, meats, and bread out and arranging the appetizers. He selects a few bottles of wine from the wine racks and opens them with a sure hand.</p> <p>Flick squints her eyes and examines the food very closely. As far as she can tell it looks normal, but the boy doesn't make to eat any of that food. For himself, he steps over to an incongruous cabinet which looks to be constructed almost of hard, thin wax, and grabs one bulbous-bottomed bottle from the full cabinet. The bottle itself is held in a golden filigreed nest, as fine as sewing threads. He pops the top, puts it to his lip, but sniffs at it and frowns. โOh, I thought we just got this. How has it gone bad already? He picks another bottle and takes a swig, but spits it out before swallowing. โI guess we got a bad batch here. He starts riffling through the bottles, and waves at <a href="/marshbout/creatures/adventurers.html">The Adventurers</a> to continue. โGo ahead, go ahead. All that stuff is for the servants, and they're in charge of getting their own food. I'm sure it'll be satisfactory -- they are given a more than sufficient <em>per diem</em>.</p> <p>Jaap suddenly decides to ask the boy where his mother is.</p> <p>Mother's been away; I don't know the last time I saw her here.</p> <p>So she's not on the estate? Jaap asks.</p> <p>No, she's been off.</p> <h3 id="an-impromptu-lesson-on-the-three-mothers"><a href="#an-impromptu-lesson-on-the-three-mothers" class="header-anchor">#</a> An impromptu lesson on the Three Mothers</h3> <p>Drav asks about the multiple mothers.</p> <p>I do have one mother, but she's also three mothers. There's the Green Mother, and the Blue and Red one -- but they're all my mother.</p> <p>Flick remembers from hanging out with <a href="/marshbout/creatures/Gonfalon.html">Gonfalon</a> that there are lots of natural and minor deities that have minor <a href="/marshbout/ontology/aspect.html">aspects</a>, such as <a href="/marshbout/creatures/rekle.html">Rekle</a>, one of the human gods of Death and the Harvest. She's still unsure of what to make of Little Brother here; given how blasรฉ he is, she wonders where he's been not to have been deeply affected by any of the events.</p> <p>Pelageena waits until Dlek is rummaging through one of the cabinets to sidle over to the adventurers. โWhat he's trying to say is that, his mother is more like his birth mother, whereas I was a <a href="/marshbout/ontology/void_doublet.html">shadowborn</a>. His mother -- hundreds of years ago they would have been called covens. Each aspect or member can present as &quot;itself,&quot; or the coven as a whole. They travel in threes, and we think that our mother was one of the last of this group that could take on a single aspect or exist as the three hags in the coven.</p> <p>Flick backs away from Little Brother. โWe tell stories of the hag-spawn to frighten ourselves around the campfire; I've never --</p> <p>The boy barely seems to be paying attention. Drav and Flick recall the <a href="/marshbout/factions/three_school.html">Three School</a> that they met; at the time they were told that the individual threeschools are unrelated to one another, but also that they are &quot;older than time&quot; and each has their own project or projects they pursue. The <a href="/marshbout/factions/juniper_three_school.html">threeschool</a> they met in the <a href="/marshbout/locations/nightmare_candy_factory.html">Nightmare Candy Factory</a> had been researching the conditions under which life and death could become fungible; they seemed to be a more eclectic threeschool than Dlek's mother. Drav and Flick guess that &quot;hag&quot; is just a term for how humans understand the manifestation of a threeschool on the <a href="/marshbout/ontology/material_plane.html">Material Plane</a>.</p> <h3 id="chattin-over-cheese"><a href="#chattin-over-cheese" class="header-anchor">#</a> Chattin-over-Cheese</h3> <p>What were you all doing here, Flick says aloud, exasperated.</p> <p>Mother doesn't always agree with herself, as you can see easiest in the conflicting &quot;suggestions&quot; (or orders) they gave to Tishara, who would be more than happy to spend time playing with horses as a dilettante veterinarian, says Pelageena.</p> <p>That's the woman who runs the thieves' guild? asks Flick.</p> <p>Precisely. The one Dlek calls Green Mother, or Melionaa, was more intersted in having Tishara pursue her interests in animals and beasts. But Valeryl, the Blue Mother, wanted Tish to become the leader of a thieves' guild, which conflicted with the Coven's preliminary consensus for us to remain here. Each one has their own wants and projects, which can class with general decisions, but the latter generally trumps the individual desires.</p> <p>Flick asks, Were you not able to leave the esate? Were you doing what you were doing so you could get out from under them?</p> <p>I'm not seen in the same light that Dlek and Tishara are. There are fewer leniencies granted to me. I didn't see any other option but to use this opportunity to escape. I'm not seen as a special project by any of them. Talma loves Dlek most; as you've seen, the red is the centermost stripe of his coloration. She's a little more flighty, which is where he inherits much of his insouciance. In fact, Valeryl was supposed to be &quot;my&quot; mother, but instead she was captured by the lure of earthly politics, which is why she turned to Tishara. I would have loved to have had explored that with her as my patron. I think there's something else going onto explain why she refuses to believe in me; something about the conditions of a shadowbirth that she doesn't trust.</p> <p>I instinctively sympathize with anyone trying to free themselves and escape into the wider world. Not that my approval means anything, Flick says.</p> <p>I see what you mean, Pelageena says. After what seems like hundreds of years in this condition -- I think for the world outside it has only been 25 years or so -- it began to wear on me.</p> <p>Are you saying that time flows differently here within the bounds of the estate? asks Flick.</p> <p>I thnk that, or perhaps it flows differently in my head. It felt like a very long time that I was trapped, especially without parents around. let alone ones that would listen to me, and with a sister who prefers the company of animals and twee urbanites. Dlek is enjoyable, but his conversational abilities leave a bit to be desires; he's almost more like one of the fey. And the knowledge from these books really filled that void for me, says Pelageena.</p> <p>They didn't contain anything in the event that the ritual was interrupted? asks Flick</p> <p>They may have, I didn't expect any of this to happen. And it's not as though I ignored taking precautions; I have this entire other duplicate room in case the forces here were too destructive. You saw how strong the ritual circle was. But โฆ the meteorite, I think we should check on it, as it holds an incredible amount of trans-planar power, having originated outside this plane.</p> <p>Flick says, part of what made me so anxious to stop this was, in my travels to the <a href="/marshbout/ontology/ethereal_plane.html">Ethereal Plane</a>, I saw something that disturbed me greatly, and I have to ask. Did your escape plan involve bringing help <em>in</em> from some other plane?</p> <p>No, those are unfortunately side effects of impairing some of these boundaries. I did research the means by which entities cross planes; the scalps and the <a href="/marshbout/ontology/substances/zolott.html">zlot</a> are known ways of establishing links between the planes, and, indeed, that's what the meteorite is, and these are all attempts at research. I myself am unable to use them in that way; my goal was to hit at the source and weaken the walls.</p> <p>Flick asks, and nothing reached out to you, like a demon prince or a trapped eldritch entity offering you a way out if you would help them?</p> <p>With an unreadable expression, Pelageena says, of course I know of the entities, but I instituted the proper precautions so they wouldn't be able to influence me.</p> <p>Well I guess you would know, Flick says. โWould you mind showing us this meteorite.</p> <p>No, let's head over.</p> <h3 id="getting-up-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-bread"><a href="#getting-up-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-bread" class="header-anchor">#</a> Getting up on the wrong side of the bread</h3> <p>You might want to nibble on some of this bread first, Vengeance interjects. โYou're looking a bit ghostly.</p> <p>Pelageena looks at herself, and for the first time notices that she's becoming visibly translucent. โYes the food isn't going to do anything to help, and if Dlek has discovered that the <a href="/marshbout/items/ambrosia.html">ambrosia</a> isn't doing the trick I think it's just a matter of time.</p> <p>Ok, but just fifโฆteen pieces of bread, Vengeance concedes.</p> <p>Bring all that you want, Pelageena graciously offers. It's some of the best we could get from Sandford. Our servants are spared nothing.</p> <p>Flick looks out for some <a href="/marshbout/items/demi_baguette.html">demi-planar baguettes</a> and takes the first one she sees, hoping it will be of some use.</p> <p>My good man, I'll have some of that bad champagne, Hog-squat? What is it? Nevermind! Could I have just a few bottles of that stuff?</p> <p>Yeah, help yourself, I don't know what you're expecting from it. And it's pretty gross.</p> <p>Truth be told there's no better way to wash down a baguette. JLB nods. โWould you like a bite, Jean-Luc-Bear? JLB opens his gaping maw. Vengeance inserts a whole baguette and pushes it in with a firm finger on the exposed end, following it up with a bottle of the &quot;champagne.&quot;</p> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>rolls</summary> <p><code>JLB Charisma saving throw, and a 1d6. He takes 40 points of radiant damage and his Strength score goes up by 4 points.</code></p></details> <p>Everyone sees that Jean-Luc-Bear's eyes shine like silver and each claw emits a brilliant silver ray of light. After a moment the intensity drops, but his eyes retain their luminance and his claws glow as if lit from the inside.</p> <p>Hey, wait a second, <em>that</em> batch wasn't bad, gimme some of that! says Dlek. He gulps some down, and the color bands of his body lose their muddiness and incandesce with the underlying hue. For a moment tiny bits of rubble hover in the air around his ankles, and his hair leaps into a full-bodied layered pyramid before the whole elevated ensemble settles back down. He lets out a sigh of satisfaction and looks at Vengeance. โLooks like I have to trust <em>you</em> from now on to pick out a good bottle. Clearly I'm no somolier.</p> <p>Seems like you didn't even check the vintage on this one, Vengeance counters. โBut this is like 50,000 years old, good stuff.</p> <p>They're all supposed to be &quot;good stuff!&quot; I got them from a reputable seller, what was her name, <a href="/marshbout/creatures/bellesprit.html">Bellesprit</a>? Anyway, glad you found the one that hasn't gone bad.</p> <p>โ The <a href="/marshbout/locations/bellesprit_vineyards.html">Bellesprit Vineyards</a>? Vengeance asks.</p> <p>โYeah! Jaap confirms.</p> <p>โ Well, it's not made from grapes.</p> <p>โ Then what causes this red color? Jaap inquired.</p> <p>Wait, that one's red? No wonder they're all bad. They're supposed to be argent.</p> <p>Jean-Luc-Bear looks around for the heaviest object in the room. Seeing Pjorg, he rushes over</p> <p>Small one, what are you doing? Pjorg objects. โGive me my space!</p> <p>JLB ignores the goliath's pleas, squeezes both his hands to his sides, and hoists him up as though he weighs no more than a bag of feathers. He hears (and smells?) the metal of Pjorg's armor crumples and buckles under the pressure. JLB puts him down, sauntering off with his new Superbear strength.</p> <h3 id="his-herring-day"><a href="#his-herring-day" class="header-anchor">#</a> His Herring Day</h3> <p>It's his birthday, Vengeance whispers to Dlek. โSo if you could do a little song when he comes back, maybe like a cupcake with a candle in it.</p> <p>Sure โฆ is that what bears like? Dlek asks, confused.</p> <p>Or a fish with a candle in it โฆ</p> <p>Yeah I think there's a dried fish around here. He walks around and stops at a barrel, nudges the head aside, and the tangy odor of salted herring pervades the room. For JLB the smell is irresistible. The bear waddles over and stuffs great pawfuls into his mouth. Dlek plucks a torch off the wall and he starts up an unfamiliar song:</p> <blockquote><p>It's the herring day for this big bear<br>
the day he was born is a herring day<br>
we gather round this burning torch<br>
and see how strong the bear is today.</p></blockquote> <p>Come on everyone, hands in! Dlek puts his hand &quot;in&quot; to the center of an imagined circle. As his hand comes down, torchfire underneath, it snuffs out the torch. The boy does not react, and his flesh appears unsinged when he pulls it away..</p> <p>How many spanks for Jean-Luc today? Vengeance moans deliciously.</p> <p><code>ZERO SPANKS</code> they all hear in their heads.</p> <p>Pelageena looks on a bit wearily and heads out the door.</p> <h3 id="the-meteor-right"><a href="#the-meteor-right" class="header-anchor">#</a> The meteor โฆ right?</h3> <p>A little under a quarter of a mile of eerily quiet air separates them from the amphitheatre. It's a dark night, but they can still see the lit campfire behind the manorhouse and the distant glow of Sandford. Fortunately, Pelageena has a torch, and JLB continues to emanate a phosphorescent glow from his claws and open eyes.</p> <p>Jaap slids in next to Vengeance. โHey, should we give Pelageena some of that wine, too? I got the impression she would like it.</p> <p>Vengeance pushes himself and Jaap up to Pelageena, whom he encircles in an affectionate hug, drunk already from the mere smell of the kippers, and tries to pass the bottle to her. Vengeance and Jaap can both smell the briny, stale waters of the logging mill pond; whoever's responsibility it was to keep it clean (much like the secret passageway) neglected their duries, and the violence of the storm undoubtedly churned up long-still waters.</p> <p>As they approach the amphitheatre, Vengeance's vision narrows until tunnellike, the aperture at the end only large enough to engulf the dark star he saw before. The curve of the amphitheatre blocks his direct vision, but it's as though he can see through the ground to where the rock is. He can feel it beating like a heart. For the briefest moment he feels a warm golden energy begin to course through his body, but before he can get a hold on it, as it were, it washes back out of him, and he's left in the darkness.</p> <p>Dlek tosses his head like a wired horse. Pelageena looks over at the monk, squints her eyes, and then turns back and proceeds towards the theater.</p> <p>The party comes up to where the stairs are carved into a hill, the benches overlooking a wide plain, and proceed down the stone steps down to where the meteorite sits. Coming closer they can tell that it's not a metallic golden-red, as they might have been expected. Instead it seems to swallow the light: of the stars, the torch, Jean-Luc's eyes; where there would otherwise have been reflected light, here there is only a deep darkness. The rock is about five feet in diameter, with a chunky, jagged outline, but without any discernible cracks or way to see into the interior.</p> <p>Jaap focuses in on a cluster of facets where flakes or shards have been somewhat systematially broken off. Drav and Flick squat to examine the rock alongside the gnome. Vengeance somewhat curiously does not recognize the meteorite and indeed is facing away from it, back towards the house. โAre we ever going to get to this thing? Where is it?</p> <p>Once more, and though oblivious, the monk feels the beating of an alien heart. Simultaneously, the party becomes aware that the rock has begun to reflect light rather than consuming it. The light that is reflected resolves into the image of a burning sphere like the sun exploding with coronal bursts. The area around them suddenly gets bright as day.</p> <p>Vengeance's body begins to sear from the inside; every nerve screams with pain. His limbs are thrown outwards like a child cartwheeling as radiant light explodes from his core.</p> <p>The meteorite begins to crack, and they can see a sickly, alien light pierce the fissures. Pelageena turns towards Vengeance โNo, an โฆ <a href="/marshbout/ontology/alharee.html">Al'haree</a>! and she begins running, as though for her life, away from the rock. Flick takes off after her.</p> <p>Vengeance believes himself to say โJean-Luc-Bear, quickly, use your new superstrength and throw it back into the sky. JLB smells the same smoke that he smelled before the explosion in the <a href="/marshbout/factions/hat_baskets.html">Hat Baskets'</a> basement. He picks up Jaap, turns and runs, too.</p> <p>Pelageena reacts to Vengeance's exhortation. โEveryone, to the bear! as she reverses course and makes for JLB, who at the same time comes to a standstill. Flick ducks and points an arrow at the meteor.</p> <p>Dlek remains utterly preoccupied with the meteorite as his sister screams โDlek, get over here, we have to go! โBut this is so โฆ beautiful, he responds.</p> <p>Does anyone have anywhere else that we can go? Pelageena wildly shouts, as the meteorite has become almost fractures of light and little darkness.</p> <p>Vengeance finds it increasingly difficult to act or think at all; he feels as though he's about to explode. Regressing to his elf infancy, he hallucinates that he's clinging to JLB's warm belly, &quot;looking for a teat to suckle at.&quot;</p> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div> <hr class="footnotes-sep"> <section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p><em>feelize</em>, v.
