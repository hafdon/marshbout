They appear to be engaged in mining a [muted blue crystalline ore], runs over and prevents the group from entering the ritual mining space -- for such it is -- until they've passed a bevy of personal questions. The mining team deliver their own side of the &quot;[stolen logbook].&quot; Everyone gets drunk and goes to sleep.</p> <p>— <a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/contributors/slamish_pystar.html">Slamish Pystar</a></p> <h2 id="transcript"><a href="#transcript" class="header-anchor">#</a> transcript</h2> <p>JL is surprised that Scunner isn't dead.</p> <blockquote><p>Flick makes a Perception check to judge the distance of the others down the tunnel. 15.</p></blockquote> <p>She thinks they are close enough to get there this round or next round if they dash. Flick, not wanting to be the first thing they see, moves and calls out to Jean-Luc, &quot;You're going to want to duck!&quot; and force-shoots Scunner.</p> <blockquote><p>23 force damage.</p></blockquote> <p>Scunner twists and puts the column between himself and the arrow, but it's clear he's in bad shape: JL's thrust to the armpit is bleeding copiously. <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Gerd.html">../../creatures/Gerd</a> flies on in …</p> <blockquote><p>Ian informs the team that summoning Gerd scales with spell level.</p></blockquote> <p>… and mauls the rogue, but it's still too lumbering to hit him. Gerd's momentum carries it over to the other side, licking the salt crystals there for a moment before turning back to face the adversary.</p> <blockquote><p>Galen arrives.</p></blockquote> <p>Vengeance admires the 'water feature,' a tasteful and well-appointed pond with a different species of fish inhabiting each step of the pool, arranged by color of the rainbow. Flick sees that the first person to round the corner is a dwarf, clad in thick woolen grey robes. She has a grey-white beard obscuring her face and a beretlike cap. She carries in her hands a staff carved out of a pure white crystal. As she casts Maximillian's Earthen Grasp, the rocky floor erupts into the shape of a hand which secures Jean-Luc in its grasp and squeezes tight. JL starts gasping for air. &quot;What … the fuck…&quot;</p> <p>Vengeance recalls that the spell is named after <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Maximillian.html">Maximillian</a>, a man who was killed by falling into an open mine, and then named for a chess move where one of the pieces goes forward a great number of spaces, sacrificing itself. As Vengeance communicates this history to JL he begins to lose consciousness.</p> <p>Flick bets dollars to <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Bort.html#Donuts">donuts</a> that this is a concentration spell.</p> <p>Breg: Parlay with us, or your friend is crushed. I know what you've come for -- it's the book you want, isn't it?</p> <div>JL: Parlay sounds good!</div> <div>Flick: Can we at least kill Scunner?</div> <div>Breg: No, Scunner's with me, as different as our ways of life are.</div> <div>Flick: It was worth a shot.</div> <blockquote><p>Vengeance, intending to use his Quixotic Qonfusion …</p></blockquote> <p>… says, &quot;release our friend here and we will do anything you wish.&quot; Flick: We'll put down our weapons Vengeance: One wish Breg: You can cast the wish spell? Flick [undecipherable] Breg: What? you broke up there in the [lava static]. Vengeance: There's lava in here? Breg: Well, as a geomancer I'm in touch with all the rocks and uh, the lava is distant but it does contribute to my signal-to-noise ratio. Flick: I said i'm pretty adept at the misty step. that's impressed people in the past. Breg: But not a wish spell. Vengeance: Yes, by &quot;wish&quot; i basically meant that we would perform one dance for you, and it would be [the misty step]. Breg: How interesting. You've certainly made different overtures than other members of the Hat Baskets. Is it -- does this spell attempt to work some kind of charm over us? V: The Hat Baskets are really upping their game, as you probably know, and they've been hiring better and better actors, and so we're part of the latest crop. Breg: You really hit the nail on the head saying &quot;actors.&quot; They merely play-act at this game that the rest of us have been involved in our entire lives, for actual stakes. V: Is it a game to you? Breg: No! Are you saying you're a performer? V: No. Breg: Then why are you so interested in this dance? What's going on here?</p> <blockquote><p><code>[Somehow Vengeance has gotten around to Confusing her, allowing him to make a good-faith Persuasion check. 18.]</code></p></blockquote> <p>Jean-Luc has been doing some kind of self-anti-boa constricting.</p> <p>Breg: We do appear to be at a standoff. Perhaps a dance would allow us to reset ourselves. Vengeance: Well, Flick, it's up to you, now.</p> <p>Flick tries her best to improvize &quot;Misty Step&quot; -- there were barn dances and such. She spent a fair amount of time moving rhythmically with other young people. Plus she's very light on her feet, and can make things look pretty good to someone standing 70 feet away. Flick, raised by humans foster parents. They weren't kind, but neither were they abusive and isolating. She can do a bastardized jig for a few minutes.</p> <blockquote><p><code>[Flick gets to make the performance check with her Dexterity modifier.]</code></p></blockquote> <p>Breg looks like she's getting into it; she's one of the stouter dwarves, and Flick is flitting around the column; she may be put in mind of tales of the elves and dwarves having huge shared feasts together. She turns back and shouts. &quot;It's ok, we've brokered a sort of truce here. I'm sure we can sort this out. You'll love what this elf is doing, by the way.&quot;</p> <p>Flick pauses to stare daggers at Vengeance, who's openly weeping at the beauty of the dance. Vengeance turns to Jean-Luc, &quot;Now I know why they call it the misty step.&quot;</p> <blockquote><p>DK points out Vengeance is not close enough, and JL is constrained by the giant rock hand.</p></blockquote> <p>JL: Very nice, still stuck in an earthen grip here.</p> <p>Scunner puts a hand up to his eye to wipe away a tear, which becomes an ice droplet and shatters on the ground. Breg lets the spell drop, and the hand crumbles back into the floor of the cave.</p> <p>JL: So we've agreed to a parlay, yes? Breg: Yes. If you wish to come back here, it's a little more hospitable, and we can talk about our mutual needs.</p> <p>Flick and JL think that they really need to keep the Gaol Maidens from finding out who he is. However, he's not sure if these people know who he is.</p> <p><code>[JL Investigation]</code></p> <p>The distance of Kriobolis from Marshbout is around 500 miles, so it's fairly unlikely they would have received information about a hit on you, since that's pretty specific and they are stationed here, and in fact if few people know they are here at all (!).</p> <p>JL flashes a [hand signal] to indicate that he comes in peace, and Scunner meets his eyes and shakily returns the hand signal; Breg doesn't appear to notice. Flick walks over and hands a goodberry to the Gaol Maiden</p> <p>Your mercy is as meaningful as your hostility, elf. What do I call you.</p> <p>Flick: My name is Flick. Scunner: The full name's Blad Schillaber, but everyone calls me Scunner. Blad has all those connotations these days. He eats the goodberry and looks quite full. &quot;I thought those roast meats had filled me up, but I guess I didn't all the corners. You're ohhhhhhhh,&quot; and he passes out. Gerd moves forward and begins to lick his wound. JL suggests to Vengeance that he tend to JL. Vengeance comes over and joins in the licking. It's clear Scunner hasn't had a fight like this in quite sometime. He wakes up to pontificate: &quot;I still don't know how I missed you with that first swipe. I mean, I know you're a fellow Maiden, but what kind of training have you had?&quot;</p> <p>JL: I imagine we come from the same school. You know how it is: you see a glint of steel and your instincts kick in. Scunner: You're right, I've probably been staring into the flames for too long. I'm not used to being underground. JL: Preaching to the quite. Scunner: Uh, huh. Sure. You don't happen to have any drink on you?</p> <p>JL offers him a swig from the Tepplin bottle.</p> <blockquote><p><code>[Would Flick have noticed the Thieves' cant hand signal? DM says no.]</code></p></blockquote> <p>Scunner sees the brewer's mark on the bottle. &quot;Ah, right on for you, did you steal this from some high-flying elites? Well done.&quot; JL: I don't know its provenance. I came across it under somewhat unusual circumstances which I'll have to relate later. Scunner: &quot;Well, you must know -- the <a href="/obsidian-general/locations/tepplin_brewery.html#distilleries">Tepplin Brewery &gt; distilleries</a> provide all the priests in Kriopolis with their sacramental wines and their religious drinks.&quot; It's clear that Scunner, with the loss of blood, the goodberry, being licked by Gerd and Vengeance, and a few shots of liquor have loosened his tongue. &quot;I hear that [somebody's making a play for their Star]. I think they want to brand beers for the common man with the Star so they can sell 'elite' drinks at higher prices.&quot; He goes on to criticize commodity branding and the sheeple that buy into it. JL: I miss the days when the lower classes brewed their own beer and had a good time doing it. Scunner: That's right! Brewing their own beer, leavening their own bread. Now they have to get it from whoever's … JL: &quot;And the leases!&quot; He goes on a rant about the economy</p> <blockquote><p><code>[Persuasion check]</code></p></blockquote> <p>It's clear that JL's bourgeoisie education start creeping into the way he's talking about things. Scunner, &quot;Ok, I see eye to eye with you. As I've said, I'm Scunner&quot; JL: Jean-Luc.</p> <blockquote><p><code>[DM establishes that, from the rolls, he doesn't know about a bounty on JL's head.]</code> %%[plots (marshbout) &gt; Bounty on Jean-Luc]%%</p></blockquote> <p>Scunner looks like the name reminds him of something. &quot;It's an odd name for Kriopolis … maybe you're from southern Albland? I know a few Jean-Lucs from there&quot; Vengeance: He spells it J-A-A-A-N L-U-K-E like a fun unconventional spelling. Such were JL's parents, I guess.</p> <blockquote><p>JL insight check.</p></blockquote> <p>JL detects that Scunner's eyes lit up when Jean-Luc said his name, and this business about other Jean-Lucs is clearly covering for something. He doesn't know about the bounty, but he's heard of you, or heard the name and now has a face. JL plays along, so Scunner doesn't know that JL knows that Scunner knows.</p> <p>Flick calls Gerd over, &quot;Flit over by that column and keep an eye on the Geomancer, and tell me what she does and says.&quot;</p> <blockquote><p><code>[Gerd is Gerd-sexual.]</code></p></blockquote> <p>Gerd communicates to you that there are a bunch of people chilling back in the tunnel. It holds up most of its hands (each with 3 claws) to indicate the number of people. Flick wants to know if they are holding weapons. It holds up one claw, and puffs his cheek up, and mimes doing a really large creature. One claw. Then he mimes smoking. 3 claws.</p> <p>Flick: So it's either a really fat guy, or an ogre. and someone toking.</p> <p>Breg: I hope you've brought more to parlay with than just that dance, unless we have to recommence hostilities, but why not come back here?</p> <p>Flick: we need to be ready to act or think fast because we're not fooling anyone at this point. JL: &quot;Scunner's assured me of safe passage. Unless things go totally sideways&quot; and he looks over to Vengeance. JL helps Scunner to his feet. &quot;I can tell you're not like the Hat Baskets; one of them has aim like you wouldn't believe, but you seem much more grounded than whatever's going on with that group. I'm still curious. None of us want to die too prematurely.</p> <p>By the time they round the corner he's a little more steady on his feet. They see a few humans hanging out in the corner and smoking.</p> <blockquote><p><code>[Insight checks.]</code></p></blockquote> <p>All except Jean-Luc recognize quickly that this is an extended family unit, unlike what those unfamiliar with thieves groups might have expected, which would have been individual ne'er-do-wells with secretive backgrounds. In addition, they see a very large creature, 12-15 feet long, looking like a scaled-up newt, emitting a yellowish-red light which they identify as the cove light. Next to the salamander is a lizardfolk who appears to be the creature's handler. The salamander is facing a heaping pile of [ore], and near its butt a smaller pile of [bright-blue cylindrical gems]. The family looks like they were the ones mining.</p> <p>Drav's 'wizard' part suddenly realizes this is a gemstone known as <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/substances/azurite.html">azurite</a>. It's a blue mineral which will slowly lose its vibrancy over time, and indeed there appears to be a kind of <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/substances/oily_rectal_mucus.html">oily_rectal_mucus</a> swaddling the crystals. Drav knows that it's used as a spell component for high-level spells that try to diminish the power of other things.</p> <p>Like [Jorgensen's Blue Balls], Flick surmises. The DM clarifies that it's more likely to be The Inverse of Jorgensen's Blue Balls, which are being crushed by Maximillians' Eearthen Hand. There is a famous [statue on the North Strictland] of that exact thing, marking the entrance into the [Valör Pass]. The 'balls' part of the statue is made of a [stable blue mineral], rather than Azurite.</p> <p>Everyone looks pretty relaxed except for someone who looks like the grandfather; he's spry but has grey hair, and a [tetrapod animated boulder] which has skeletal arms and legs protruding from it.</p> <p>Fundi: Breg says you're hear to parlay, and not to interrupt our mining? JL: We have no reason to stop your mining. Not our bailiwick. Fundi: Well as you can see I've set up this periphery of ribbons; they area traditional part of the goings-on. I must ask you a few questions as you approach the area. Have any of your been infidelitous to your spouses or significant others? Flick: I'm not married. JL turns to the group: Are any of us married? Vengeance: Uh, yeah! But it would take me a few days to figure out how to answer that question truthfully. It depends on so many definitions. Fundi: Can you stay as far away from the mining, then? Since that's going to disrupt the blessing we're trying to impose on this area. Flick: Is azurite oxidized by perverts or something? Fundi: Well, yes, kindof. The ore gets corrupted and it's much more difficult to smelt -- and, furthermore, nasty effects can attend those who don't follow the proper ritual precautions that must be taken. Vengeance: Does it matter, sir, that my Wife happens to be a mule and is, in fact, not manogamous. Fundi: Is she here? With you? Vengeance: No. Fundi: Well … I've already asked you to stay as far away as possible. But let me ask. Nyuka! I have a theological question for you! Nyuka, the lizardfolk handler of the salamander. &quot;Yes, what's your question.&quot; Fundi repeats what Vengeance has told him. Nyuka: No, as long as she stays far away it shouldn't have any effect. Fundi: Ok, then you may enter, but for a number of reasons, some of which are merely the general unpleasantness of being in close proximity to you, I ask that you keep your distance from the mining. Vengeance: Yes, that will do, thank you.</p> <p>Vengeance takes a look at some of these ribbons comprising the perimeter fence. Fundi says they are fabrics of some rarity, originating likely from the &quot;Acha Bashoor&quot; continent to the southwest.</p> <blockquote><p>History or religion check to determine legitimacy of the pomp. Ian declines to roll, as Flick would not quibble with Fundi's explanations. Most roll a 10.</p></blockquote> <p>Many practices that concern extracting rare earth materials do involve a great deal of magic and ritual. Depending on where you fall on the religion/spirituality spectrum, you might believe the necessity more or less. Depending on Drav's increasing contact with Eldar, she may develop more respect for it. But they may regard it as &quot;hooey&quot; even if they don't believe in it themselves, but you wouldn't tell someone not to go to church.</p> <p>Jean-Luc knows that Acha Bashoor is south of Kriobolis, which is on the isthmus dividing Ys from Bashoor. There are beautiful textiles and port cities which export the same. Flick is only vaguely aware that there are even other landmasses. She's pretty provincial, but commits to play along with their ribbon-dance games. She is also romantically inexperienced, so finds Fundi's prodding somewhat offputting. Of course, a kiss and cuddle happened at the barn dances, but she watched most of her peers die. She outlived her foster parents while she was an &quot;adolescent&quot; -- she saw several generations of her environs live, marry, and die, while she looked the same. Other people know that she's not part of the dating pool.</p> <blockquote><p>The DM relates that the world does abide by plate techtonics where possible. But he does admit that the ecosystems don't make as much sense as they might. The DM also pictures Flick as Jack Nicholson showing up in time cycles at the Shining, returning to ask who's going to be at the next barn dance.</p> <p>Flick was found as an infant, is 75 now. Recently it occured to Ian that she outlived her foster parents and is late adolescent relative to elf life cycles, and a little damaged in being raised by faster-living humans. It can be a big or small a part of the campaign as desired. Her life in that town must have been pretty weird. Imagine a human raised by a series of their pets.</p></blockquote> <p>Breg approaches Drav; she's a fairly old Dwarf, probably 400 years old. All her hair is grey and white. Her face looks literally chiseled from rock, which appears to have infused the character of her face. Drav gets a vibe that she's pretty intuitive about this kind of stuff. &quot;I can tell that you've recently been dabbling in the ways in which dwarves can communicate with rocks and mold rocks to their will.&quot; Drav: That's absolutely correct. I didn't grow up with much exposure to that. My parents are elves, they loved me very much, but and I didn't learn much about this stonework.</p> <p>Breg: that's very interesting, and now you find yourself drawn to it. Have you found any expertise or instruction on your travels? Or doing your own research? Drav: I've done a lot of reading, but it's not the same as practicacl experience. We seem to get distracted by many things along our journey. Breg: If you were to practically engage, how would you envision doing so? Drav: The way you seem to be able to read the rock and stone, and mold and shape it, that's not something I've ever done myself, or seen done. Breg: What you've seen so far are almost parlor tricks of the geomancer. These are commonplace spells for magically inclined dwarves. I myself am too old to take on an apprentice, but there are areas in the world that would love to take on a dwarf of your inquisitive nature to learn of the living rock.</p> <p>She scribbles down a small map of the area, and identifies some mountains to the east: there's a well renowned teacher here, her name is Obnovenie Sveta. she's unique in a number of ways, one of which is eschewing the traditional dwarven habit of taken a last name that's a noun compound; she said that the name was given to her by one of the earth elementals. I think you would be perfect precisely because of your knowledge of the written word. She teaches dwarves to learn the powers of the earth through runes that are inscribed into the rocks themselves, and it acts as a mediating, plastic medium for those who have the power within themselves but just need a channel through which to direct that power.</p> <p>But in the meantime I can certainly teach you the rudiments of the spell I was able to cast on your roguish friend. She takes Drav's hand, spits onto the wall behind her, rubs the stylus in the stone ink, and inscribes the text of the spell into her spellbook, holding drav's hand under hers</p> <blockquote><p>Maximillian's Earthen Guuuuurrrrrrrrasp</p></blockquote> <p>Drav hugs Breg, who hugs her back. They are both strong. In this instance Drav expresses deference to her elder, and Breg gives her a rib cracking hug, that feels warm, parental, strengthening, all in one.</p> <blockquote><p>Inspiration point.</p></blockquote> <p>Fundi gets up on the turnbuckle and presses down the ribbons and motions to everyone to come in. Breg turns to Flick, &quot;are you acting as an agent for the hat baskets. scunner seems to think you're not quite of their ilk.&quot;</p> <p>Flick, &quot;I didn't even know the hatpins from adama before i arrived here. the way i help friends is by shooting things, and I'm sorry we had to cross paths in that way. no hard feelings.&quot;</p> <p>Breg: you'd have to take that up with scunner -- we did post him as a guard. all things being equal, i'd say put it in the past</p> <p>Scunner: i think it was a fight well met and well returned. there are no hard feelings here. I've seen it go worse so many times. his lower lip starts to tremble as he stares into space. JL pours some fortifying liquor into his mouth.</p> <p>JL: we seem to have found ourselves in a dispute that we're not sure we're a part of. we have almost literally, and definitely figuratively, stumbled in here.</p> <p>Breg: so what was it that did bring you here?</p> <p>JL: you guys are a cell, outfit, or extension of the gaol maidens?</p> <p>Breg: The <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/ruhu_family.html">Ruhu family</a> here would think of themselves as a self-contained family unit within the GM, i'm not sure if they see themselves as an extension. Fundi: We were able to claim this mining spot for ourselves, and that has to be honored by the GMs JL: So it's a franchise opportunity. Fundi: In a way. JL: I had some dealings with the GM back in Krobopolis, then we were approached by the Hat baskets who were trying to wind us up to send us after you because of whatever turf war you two are in. But we have no interest in either side of that dispute. Flick: There was the matter of the aethereal firebomb. JL: Yeah, was that you?</p> <p><a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Nyakatagara.html">Nyaka</a> perks up. &quot;Did you say there was an explosion?&quot; Flick: A very strange one. (and, unguardedly, describes what it looked like from the aethereal plane.).</p> <p><code>Insight checks all around. Drav is still beaming after hugging Breg and notices nothing. Flick and JL do well.</code></p> <p>JL notices  he used to know the name of his city; the fact that he doesn't know how to pronounce it anymore is worrisome; something mystical might be going on. Flick notices something similar, a little ameliorated, but she hasn't seen anyone (except maybe when her original foster parents got dementia) thinks JL might be under a localized aphasia. She knows of a legend that Gonfalon told her, of a dark wood, when people would live within the shadow of the wood, they couldn't remember anything that had happened during that period of time. She's been noticing this since she's known JL.</p> <p>Vengeance: JL, why don't you just call it C-town, or the Big C. that's what I do with my monastery.</p> <blockquote><p>JL intelligence check</p></blockquote> <p>Flick does know of a Kriobolis.</p> <p>JL can't remember if it's spelled with a K or a C.</p> <p>Flick hears &quot;kribopolis&quot; and asks to be excused by the dwarves, hops over the club ribbon, and walks to JL. Can you repeat after me: Kree-ah-bo-lis . JL repeats it fine, no problem. &quot;Sorry, dwarves, a bit of house keeping.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;I hate to get involved in this sort of thing, but, well, …&quot; Flick: by all means, everyone's up in our shit. &quot;I'm gonna let Nyaka ask you about the explosive device while I pontificate&quot;</p> <p>Nyaka comes over: &quot;it sounds like … describe to me more this explosion.&quot; Flick does her best. they smelled smoke and JL saw an ingot under vengeance's crate. &quot;I'm able to step into neighboring planes. it was a bright radiation in the ethereal plane.&quot; Nyaka: you may need to speak with the elves. I don't know what this is. Flick: mother -- you don't think i'm a vampire too, do you? Nyaka: no, elves. <a href="/obsidian-general/creatures/Lhaska.html">Lhaska</a> keeps me warm no matter what the temperature; we have quite a bond between us. As a warmblood, you wouldn't understand. It also sounds like you weren't told that we were working a joint venture with the <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/hat_baskets.html">Hat Baskets</a> to mine the <a href="/obsidian-general/ontology/substances/iridium.html">iridium</a>. Flick: that sounds expensive Nyaka: it is, a very rare metal. if we'd had our way, we would have been the only ones taking the ore. but the hatbaskets had managed to maneuver into a position of negotiation, and we were forced to split with them. flick: they didn't tell us about this. the explosion went off, -- no one died, but they were very hurt, and they immediately pointed us your way.</p> <p>Drav, at the time, noticed that the explosion was an iridium-like material. It's very rare on the crust of the planet. in order to find a vein is almost unheard of. (Iridium is completely resistant to rust.)</p> <p>Nyaka: i'm not the first to say this, but those naive idiots probably didn't know the danger of the material; all our sources tell us that they're trading with the <a href="/obsidian-general/factions/teallach_gormflaith.html">Gormflaith</a> in the Sea of Kosht.</p> <p>Fez had mentioned the Gormflaith as being on the Majestic Elf -- sea pirates that live in marshy areas, interested in iridium as it's rust resistant and an elite high-value material for weapons.</p> <p>Nyaka: I don't know what would cause it to explode like that, though. was the … mandling they took from us nearby it at the time? the salamander child? (-- the creature underneath the bench. the bench was close to vengeance's seat. (they recall that it was about 5 or 6 feet away). )</p> <p>Nyaka: it's possible that an immature mandling, unable to control its heat, could have caused an explosion, but i think something else could have been going on. but in any case, you say that they do still have the lizard child</p> <p>vengenace: the lizard child!</p> <p>nyaka: i don't know why the hat baskets are so vicious, but they stole lhaska's baby and refused to give it back, and we had no choice but to take the log book. JL: do you think they'll make that trade? Nyaka: they haven't shown any indication so far. Vengeance: Nyackha! Nyaka: You pronounced my name in the ancient way! Vengeance: No i had a great joke. Nyaka: ok, go ahead Vengeance: I was going to compare our &quot;common beef&quot; to the handsome jean-luc, who is a peasant, and thus also, &quot;common beef&quot; Nyaka: Very good</p> <p>behind Lhaska , there is a spit on which an entire roasting sheet is rotating, and from which parts have been eaten.</p> <p>Fundi has some markings on his face that look like they could have been blood.</p> <p>Vengeance: well now i'm really distracted: is that sheep for your salamander? Nyaka: you really don't know what the salamander eats? V: nnnnnnnoo Nyaka: we feed it the ore, and inside its body, it performs the smelting, and excretes the pur mineral, the azurite. V: that's the way my favorite coffee is made. well i was going to offer a trade. perhaps we could kill a few hat baskets, and in exchange we can take this fine lizard. Nyaka: we've refrained from killing as much as possible. they're just annoying rich people; if we could have made this ransom exchange it would have been the preferred outcome. and also, i would never give up Lhaska. we are almost as Lovers, in your hot blooded terms. V: everything must have its price Nyaka: no, that seems like a capitalist perspective. here we're largely [family or clan or lineage-based system of thief-traders] V: i would sell my wife for fifty … dubloons?</p> <p>Breg: Is that because you've been infidelitous? Out of the ribbon area. GET. HIM. OUT.</p> <p>Fundi approaches Vengeance and Scunner bats him back. V: Not you too, scunner Scunner. i gotta listen to Breg, man. She can literally make the rocks swallow me.</p> <p>JL: the HB stole your salamander, you stole their logbook, they're unwilling to make the trade, do we know what they want with your salamander?</p> <p>Nyaka: as you can see, salamanders are capable of almost elemental feats with minerals. I expect that's their intention. Breg: what Nyaka told you is not the whole truth. we took their logbook because it's of a magnitude of power far beyond what they can control, for quite petty reasons, so they know when their captains arrive in port. they don't even know that the corresponding logs the captains possess will corrupt them over time, and that this log can't be controlled but rather is something which controls you over time. i think -- we are not willing to give it back to them, i must admit, even if they did want to.</p> <p>JL: i remember why i left the theives' guild now. all these internal squabbles.</p> <p>Breg: we would like to think we're on the right side of things JL: it's what everybody thinks Breg: I guess you have a point. JL: why do you think the log book is corrupting them?</p> <p>Breg: it's because they've portrayed it to you as just a <a href="/obsidian-general/items/Log_of_Pathytus.html">log book</a>. the magician who originally created it, [Pathytus], he was a magician … from beyond the stars, and his magic when applied here, could only do harm to the consciousnesses native to this planet, and the areas from where he came, the consciousnesses were merged into a single field, undifferentiatable, and i believe that this logbook, were it allowed to propagate its influence, would bring about the same on this planet. creating a sort of horde or swarm of ethically divested intellect.</p> <p>vengeance remembers training at the monastery, reading [a text that concerned the synchronization of the rotation of the celestial spheres]. he rememberes that the sphere in which this planet is inscribed was believed to intersect with the other sphere every thousand years, intersecting twice once every thousand years looking like bike spokes -- this other sphere was thought to be inhabited by the kind of collective intelligence that the geomancer is describing.</p> <p>vengeance: yeah, it's just a mcguffin guys. flick has read enough of the demerast saga that she knows what a mcguffin is.</p> <p>flick: if the whole point is to get this from point a to point b, should we take it, or can we ask nicely?</p> <blockquote><p><code>[Insight check from JL for battle intelligence on their odds in this fight]</code></p></blockquote> <p>Vengeance: but, if we want a salamander, assuming the child has the same properties as this one, we need only go back to the hat baskets, and steal from them because they are clearly incompetent; so I say we go and steal that lizard. we definitely want to steal the lizard, right?</p> <p>JL: Seems worth asking: are we sure we want to be involved in this conflict? We do have those gnolls to save. And I was only investigating this to see if we're connected. If Yolandar does have a price on my head, it hasn't reached marshbout yet.</p> <p>JL: How dangerous is it if the hat baskets have the baby salamander? What level of malfeasance are we talking about? (he asks…) Nyaka: How dangerous is it if the hatbaskets have your child? JL: In the grand scheme of things, I'd be devastated. Nyaka yes, it's devastating; emotionally and psychologically it takes quite a toll. we will have to … make a run to free it, i believe, soon. Flick: so that salamander that was drying our asses, that belongs to these people? well then we have to help them. these guys stole this log book, but that's a living creature that has to stare at people's assess all day. we're not going to let that happen, right? Drav: I agree with flick. JL: let's go make another enemy. Flick: i have plenty of notches … left? on my belt? for enemies. Nyuka: You'll help? Flick: we're going to get back your -- JL: -- don't give them guarantees! Nyuka: well in that case, why don't you join us in the feast. We have to eat this entire sheep before we can proceed with the mining. As long as none of you are infidelitous. JL: what if you've caused others to be infidelitous? Breg: What do you mean exactly? JL: So, I'm not married, but I've had several affairs with married men and women. Breg: And none of them believed it to be exclusive? JL: No…? You know how it is. Breg: An interesting blind spot in this practice. We must convene.</p> <p>Breg, Nyaka, and Fundi come over and knock heads. They talk for a few moments. They all look very happy.</p> <p>This is even better than we thought! It explodes our conceptual notions of what constitutes fidelity, obligation, and responsibility. Even your weird half-elf friend is welcome into the circle.</p> <p>Flick: Wow, let's have some roast.</p> <p>JL intuits that they might have gotten things wrong here, and it might affect the success of this operation and the future luck of anyone who participates.</p> <blockquote><p>How does he know that?</p></blockquote> <p>JL motions to Fundi: when was the last time the original text was reviewed? Fundi: Well this is a tradition that's been passed down orally over generations, so I wouldn't say there's an original text. It largely involves getting involved with our family spirit Ruhu, which may have been mentioned before. JL: and when was that? Fundi: when we sacrificed the sheep, that was to Ruhu, and we spread the blood over our faces, and eating the sheep, in order to placate Ruhu with the magnitude of the ceremony.</p> <p>Vengeance has a daydream where his face is smeared with blood and he's eating a leg of mutton? &quot;Come over here and let me shotgun you some meat.&quot; He takes JL's head in his hands in order to -- he jolts alert.</p> <p>JL thinks that they are so excited by what's going on, that they are overlooking any ritual specifics. Since he doesn't believe in the metaphysical nature of this anyway, (like someone misreading a starchart of astrology) he doesn't care and starts to eat.</p> <p>They bring out roasted flatbreads and beer; they ask you to pass around the Starr liquor. They fill their bellies and no man lacked his share of the feast. the annoying younger brother [Haigi] says that, and JL thinks to himself: did this idiot also have to study heroic poems? are they still teaching that?</p> <blockquote><p>Charisma check.</p></blockquote> <p>Fundi approaches V. &quot;You know, i could tell you wanted this little boomerang to return to your hand&quot; and goes to grab at V's crotch. &quot;I'm afraid that one won't come back to you.&quot; - &quot;But, I expose myself; there's -- when I was growing up, one of my schoolmates went on to become an artificer, he went on to infuse weapons with spells. There's a spell which I believe is called … I'm sure an artificer would be able to tell you. it allows your weapon to return to your hand, with just the action of the mind. If you were able to find an artificer with this spell you could ahve the weapon you desire.&quot; - Vengeance: &quot;i'll just write down my address for you.&quot;</p> <p>Flick: Peglini's Plenty Persuasive Plea to Return.</p> <p>&quot;Look it's returning weapon, yes.&quot; - Vengeance: Flick, you knew all along? I'm going to kill you.</p> <p>Fundi sits back to watch drama: oh is there a disagreement between you two, oh yes? Vengeance: who even are you? Fundi: I'm just an old man who knows his rocks, who knows how to get his rocks off. Flick: We sure can pick 'em guys. V: I guess he's a part of the group now.</p> <p>Nyaka comes over to JL; she's also affected by the beer. She and Lhaska have been swooning on each other; she's high on passion and drink. Nyaka: As a lover, I can see that you hold two items that wish they were more united than they are now. (and she points to his daggers). I have the privilege of a rare love magic that allows me to unite even inanimate objects. Could I see them?</p> <blockquote><p>Is this an innuendo? he rolls badly, so thinks it is.</p></blockquote> <p>Vengeance: No, she wants you to cut her! JL: Oh (dejectedly) she probably did just want the daggers.</p> <p>Nyaka wanders over to Lhaska, basking in her own heat. both of the lizards hold their tongues out, which she cuts with the daggers, which she coats in the blood which is then absorbed into the daggers, kind of like the iruvian metal. You'll find that these should perform much better when you wield them together.</p> <blockquote><p>For these daggers, you have the Two Weapon Fighting feat.</p></blockquote> <p>Many thanks! and he offers her a celebratory lift of his glass. Nyaka: yes, this elixer has done quite the job on my reptilian brain. wink If you ever develop a cloaca, you should come and see us. JL: given how my last couple dates have gone, that is not out of the question. Nyaka: You're very charming for a human. (SHe goes and nuzzles up next to Lhaska and falls asleep.)</p> <blockquote><p>intended Long Rest begins</p> <p>End of session</p></blockquote> <div><br> <hr> <br> <span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/">sessions</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/session_000-day-by-day.html">journal</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/days/">days</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/recaps/">recaps</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/levels/">levels</a> <span> | </span></span><span><a href="/obsidian-general/sessions/arcs/">arcs</a> <!----></span> <br></div></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/hafdon/obsidian-general/edit/mac/marshbout/sessions/recaps/session_046_no_man_lacked_his_share.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help improve the page?</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
